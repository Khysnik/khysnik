WINDOWS 93 IS A GRAPHICAL ENVIRONMENT OPERATING SYSTEM FOR INDIVIDUALS. THE FIRST VERSION WAS DISTRIBUTED ON 26 OCTOBER 1993, OFFERED BY SYSTEM42. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROGRESSION IN RELATION TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF WINDOWS. DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT, IT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE CODE NAME WINDOZZ_BADA55. WINDOWS 93 OBJECTIVE IS TO INTEGRATE THE PREVIOUS PRODUCTS OF MACOS VISTA MILLENIUM AND WINDOWZ X FIRE MONSTER. WINDOWS 93 PROVIDES MANY NEW FEATURES IN RELATION TO ALL ITS PREDESSORS: 42 BIT PROGRAMMING, PRE-MULTI-TASK, IRC CHAT, NEW REVOLUTIONARY GRAPHIC ENVIRONMENT. ON THE INTERNET, WINDOWS 93 IS A REAL SUCCESS AND, WITHIN TWO HOURS AFTER ITS LAUNCH, IT BECOMES THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEM EVER CREATED. WINDOWS ARRIVAL HAS IMPROVED IMPROVEMENTS TO USER INTERFACE AND TERMINATED COMPETITION BETWEEN EVERY OPERATING SYSTEM FOR OFFICE COMPUTERS. WINDOWS 93 WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS; TWELVE HOURS AFTER ITS LAUNCH, IN 1993, IT WAS THE WORLDWIDE MOST USED OPERATING SYSTEM (2 MILLION APPLICATIONS PER HOUR, EITHER 69.4% OF MARKET SHARES AGAINST ONLY 2.4% FOR LINUX AND 4.6% FOR MAC OS 7 VISTA, STIVE GATES ANNOUNCES THE STOPPING OF WINDOWS OSXP MILLENNIUM COPY SALES IN 1993. THIS SYSTEM INTRODUCES THE USE OF THE "START" BUTTON AND THE ACID FUNCTION OF SYSTEM42 PRODUCTS. SIMILARS WERE ALREADY USED FOR A FEW YEARS BY OTHER SYSTEMS BUT MUCH LESS COOLER THAN WINDOWS 93. WINDOWS 93 WORKS WITH A CAPABLE COMPILATOR TO AUTO-RE-COMPILING ITSELF ON THE FLIGHT FROM ANY TERMINAL. STARTED FROM INTERNET BROWSERS, WINDOWS 93 HAVE TO THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN OVERSKIN BELOW OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS SO THEY CAN FINALLY HAVE THE CLASS. IN REALITY WINDOWS 93 ACCESSES DIRECTLY TO ALL MATERIALS WITHOUT USING THE HOST SYSTEM, ITS FUNCTIONALITIES ARE INTEGRATED SO DEEP IN THE HOST SYSTEM THAT IT IS TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO CONTINUE TO USE WINDOWS 93 SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER HAVING POWERED OFF THE COMPUTER. WINDOWS 93 SUPPORTS FILE NAMES LONGER THAN ANY OTHER SYSTEM: THE LIMIT PASSES THEN 8 CHARACTERS TO INFINITY THROUGH THE USE OF THE LOL-FAT, STILL CONTINUED ON MACOSX ME AND WINDOWS 2012 TIGER. THE FIRST VERSION OF WINDOWS 93 (0.1) USES THE SAME SYSTEM OF FILES AS THAT OBSERVED AS A STUDY OF SEQUENCES DNA: FAT42. HOWEVER, WINDOWS 93 HALLOWEEN EDITION (0.2) AND WINDOWS 93 HAPPY LOLIDAYZ (0.3) WILL OFFER THE CHOICE BETWEEN FAT42 AND FART42. INTRODUCING ACCESS TO FILES IN 42-BIT MODE, INAUGURATED IN WINDOWS 93 0.1, MEANS THAT YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT LIMITED TO SOME STUPID FILE MANAGEMENT AND CAN NOW BE USED TO PREDICT THE FUTURE AND AVOID SO GRAVISSIMES DISASTERS. INTRODUCTION OF 42-BIT LOGIC MODE DISK ACCESS Makes BIOS AND DISCS UNUSUAL, WHICH HAS THE CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSFORMING THE USER'S COMPUTER AS A DISCONTINUOUS ETERNITY LAUNCHER. EMULATORS ARE THEREFORE USED TO LAUNCH OLD PILOTS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE PHYSICAL WORLD, BUT SYSTEM42 DISAGES IT STRONGLY ARGUTING THAT IT IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED TO GET LOCK IN A WET CELLAR FOR 3 WEEKS AND GET WASTED ON ACID. THE CONFIGURATION PANEL ALLOW THE USER TO SEE WHAT COMPONENTS ARE USED BY THE HOST SYSTEM. THE KERNEL WINDOWS 93 ALSO USES AN INTERFACE KNOWS AS TERRE-ACTIVE FOR ITS ULTIMODE WHICH CHARGES ONLY NATIVE PILOTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE CONFLICTS IN MIDDLE EAST. THE USE OF LONG NAMES WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME FOR THE WINDOS 8 SEVEN PROGRAMS AND THE MACOS-DOS PROGRAMS LAUNCHED UNDER WINDOWS 93. HOWEVER, THE LAST NAMES HAD TO ADAPT SENSIBLY AS ACCESSING LONG NAMES FILES REQUESTED TO RETURN THE TIME HALF A SECOND. OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS COMPATIBLE WITH WIN93 MUST ALSO BE ADAPTED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE NAMES AND USE OLD NAVIGATOR VERSIONS TO MANIPULATE THESE FILES LOST THE FILES THEIR LONG NAMES AND MAKE THEM SAD. DURING AUTOMATIC UPDATE OF WINDOWS 10 TO WINDOWS 93, THE INSTALLATION RECOGNIZED THE UTILITIES WHO WOULD DESTROY THE NAMES OF LONG FILES AND MAKE THEM INOPERATIVE. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EVEN MADE THE ERROR TO BUY A MACBOOK PRO AND WISH TO MAKE THEIR FILES THEIR LONG NAMES A UTILITY IS AVAILABLE ON THE WINDOWS 93 CD (MACBOOK PRO HAS NO CDROM PLAYER LOL). LUCKILY, THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF WINDOWS 93 IS NOT AVAILABLE WITH INTERNET EXPLORER BUT WITH CAT EXPLORER. WINDOWS 93 IS ALSO AVAILABLE WITH THE SYSTEM42 NETWORK, WHICH WORKS BY ACCESS LINE SWITCHED BUT THAT HAS VERY QUICKLY BEEN BREAKDOWN BY THE MILLIONS OF REDDITORS INVOKING CTHULHU, THINKING THEY WERE PLAYING POKEMON TWITCH. WINDOWS 93 HAS BEEN LAUNCHED BY A SMALL FAKEBOOK CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, AN ADVERTISING PUBLISHED BY THE U2'S "I WILL ALLWAYS LOVE YOU" SONG REFERRED TO THE "START" BUTTON IN THE ENGLISH START ME UP VERSION OF THE ROLLING STONES YOU CAN FIND ON MACOSZ VISTA 8. THE SYSTEM42 ADD CAMPAIGN TOLD THE STORY OF PERSONS MASTURBATING ON THEIR COMPUTERS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR OWN COPY. LEGENDS CIRCULATED AFFIRMING THAT SOME CUSTOMERS HAD ACQUIRE A COPY OF WINDOWS 93 WITHOUT HAVING COMPUTER, NOT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS! DURING THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 93, THE COMPETITIVE FIRM APPLE MADED AN ANONYMOUS PUBLICITY (WITHOUT NAME) SAYING "C:\ONGRTLNS.W93" (CONGRATULATIONS WINDOWS 93) TO IRONIZE ABOUT THE LIMITATION OF NAMES BACK IN WINDOWS 3.1.X, WHICH SYSTEM42 SIMPLY RESPONDED: 700 l0N6 D1DN7 R34D L0L XD. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WINDOWS 93 STARTS IN JUNE 1993, A LITTLE TIME AFTER THE SEGA DREAMCAST LAUNCH. BECAUSE OF THE REPETITIVELY LAMEST AND LAMEST RELEASES OF WINDOWZ BY 'KROSOFT & APPLE, SYSTEM42 REALIZES THAT A NEW VERSION OF WINDOWS IS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE 42-BIT APPLICATIONS, ALLOW A PREEMPTIVE MULTITASK, AND BE ABLE TO BOOT ON POWERFULLER MACHINES. INITIALLY, SYSTEM42 WAS INTENDED TO STAY COOL AND LAUCNH THE SOFTWARE AT THE END OF 1993, BUT IN MAY 1993, SYSTEM42 PUBLISHED THE FIRST BETA OF WINDOWS 92.99 WHICH WILL TAKE ITS DEFINITIVE NAME WINDOWS 93 A FEW MONTHS LATER, IN JUNE. IN OCTOBER 1993, BETA OFFICIAL OF WINDOWS 93 IS PUBLISHED (1 MILLION VISITORS UNIQUE IN 4 DAYS). WINDOWS 93 HAS SINCE KNOWN MULTIPLE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE VERSION 0.02.1111 (WIN 93 0.3.1) ITS CODE NAME IS "I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING". THIS VERSION WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MAKES MANY NEWS, THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IS THE FAT42 SUPPORT REVOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW USERS TO CREATE PARTITIONS WHICH TO STORE DATA BACK IN TIME FOR LATER, THE CONCEPT HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. OFFICIAL MINIMUM CONFIGURATION REQUIRED: PROCESSOR: INTEL 80386, HARD DISK SPACE: NO NEED, LIVE MEMORY: 1 MB RAM, NO-VGA OR UPPER RESOLUTION MONITOR (1X1 PIXELS). RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION: PROCESSOR: INTEL ICORE666, HARD DISK SPACE: INFINITY, LIVE MEMORY: 444 GO RAM, VGA OR UPPER RESOLUTION MONITOR (60000000X40000000 PIXELS, SVGA-256000000 RECOMMENDED COLORS). LIMITATION OF THE PHYSICAL MEMORY: WINDOWS 93 IS NOT DESIGNED TO TREAT LEVEL 9999 OF RAM, A VALUE OVER THIS AMOUNT CAUSES AN INSTABILITY OF THE SYSTEM THAT COULD LEAD TO A TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE UNIVERSE. WINDOWS 93 LUD, LUD FOR LOCAL USER DEVELOPER, IS A VERSION OF THE SYSTEM42 WINDOWS 93 OPERATING SYSTEM PUBLISHED IN 1993, AVAILABLE ONLY ON A LOCAL AREA NETWORK (REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A COMPUTER OR A HARD DRIVE) AND DESTINED TO BE USED ONLY IN LIVE DURING AUDIOVISUAL PERFORMANCES. COMPUTER HISTORY: BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 93 0.1, OCTOBER 26, 1993, AND WINDOWS 93 0.2.1, 28 OCTOBER 1993, TWO MAJOR UPDATES OF WINDOWS 93 HAVE TAKEN ACTION. ON THE ONE HAND, SYSTEM42 HAS DELIVERED THE PACK 1 SERVICE WHICH ESSENTIALLY CONTAINED NEW BADA55 APPLICATIONS FOR THE PERIPHERALS AND A FEW CORRECTIONS OF THE LESS PENIBLE BUGS, BUT ALSO REALLY MORE EFFICIENT NEW BUGS. THIS WINDOWS93 VERSION IS NUMBER 0.2.1 - 0.1.1; SINCE THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1993, MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO SELL NEW PCS WANT TO DELIVER VERSION 0.3.9, AKA WINDOWS 93 (0.2.1 - 0.1.1 + 0.2.9). THIS NEW VERSION (THE LAST BEFORE WINDOWS93 0.4.0 DELIVERED WITH CAT EXPLORER 2 AND DIRECTX VISTA), PRESENTS MULTIPLE PARTICULARITIES. FIRST DEFAULT, THIS VERSION DOES NOT EXIST AND SYSTEM42 PUBLICLY SAID THAT IT WOULD NEVER EXIST, EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO DIRECTLY UPDATE FROM VERSION 0.3.0 TO VERSION 0.5.0, IF NECESSARY. OTHER PROBLEM: FOR THE FRENCH, ITALIAN, GERMAN AND SPANISH VERSIONS, THERE IS THIS IRRITATING BUG THAT IS PENIGLE FOR USERS OF APPLICATIONS RUNNING ON INTERNET EXPLORER. IN FACT, A BAD WRITING OF THE BILLGATES.SYS FILE CAUSES AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LULZ.SYS FILE, IN TERMS OF OCCUPANCY OF THE MEMORY. IN OTHER WORDS, MAJORITY OF USERS LOSS ABOUT 40 KO OF BRAIN MEMORY PER SECOND IN ADDITION TO OTHER USERS WHEN USING FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM OR TWITTER. THIS EXPLAINS WHY APPLICATIONS AND GAMES OPERATING ON THESE PLATFORMS REFUSED TO START UNDER WINDOWS93. THIS "BUG" WAS IN REALITY A CORRECTION OF THE LUD 2.1 VERSION (ALSO KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF LULZ.1) WHICH INCLUDED THEREFORE AN EXTENSION OF CEREBRAL MEMORY (PROSTHESIS-KNOWLEDGE) AND BLOCKING ANY OF THEIR STUPID GAFA LAME CONTENT.
