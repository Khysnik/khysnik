Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.

Typing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93, while typing "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
Typing "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.
Typing "__discord__" will disconnect you from Trollbox. 

There's also an unused filter that is supposed to make "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been disabled.

Refreshing the page the trollbox messages are cleared.

When spamming in trollbox it should contain lot of people like about 1000, and needs be ban hammered your ip.

Closing window lot of people are left because they closed the window. Contains spam.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

page:Trollbox Bots date:20191104145840 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of November 4th, 2019, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
?help,
ALBOT 2,
DudeBot V2,
Korrake (only can be seen when user Jayce is in trollbox),
discbot,
kay,
markov,
HugBot.

!!!Here is a list of former bots:
ALBOT, 
Welcome!,
canada,
europe,
TorBot/1024/MOBIUS (remodeled, now ?help),
kat,
fBot/Faggot/Troolbot™,
BONZIBOT,
j.help,
⚠️,
6pointoh,
free,
justin biebot/pedobear,
wAIfu,
echo,
elizabot,
Caleb.

!!Example code
{{{
const socket = require("socket.io-client")("http://windows93.net:8081");
const io = require('socket.io-client');
 
const sock = io("http://www.windows93.net:8081", {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transportOptions: {
    polling: {
      extraHeaders: {
        "Origin": "http://www.windows93.net",
        "Referer": "http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php"
      }
    }
  }
})
 
sock.on('connect', function(){
    sock.emit("user joined", "BotTemplate", "white");
})
 
sock.on('message', function(data){
    if(data.msg.startsWith('@template')){
       sock.emit('message', 'template')
    }
})
}}}

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

This is the 93 Realms wiki: https://93-realms.fandom.com/wiki/93_Realms_Wiki

don't make pages for nothing it makes me sad.. also I'm probably gonna ban you ;-;

i understand the last one was pointless, but this one is not for nothing. when you decipher the code you get a link to the translator which can be used in trollbox, bindowzuchan, 93 realms, and anything involving texting in any way, shape, or form. ip:77.243.100.176

!File creation
NOTE: $db and localforage both use IndexedDB, they just use a different wrapper. You cannot use $db to get localStorage files and vice-verca

 localforage.getItem('filename.txt').then(function(okthen){return okthen}) // get contents of a file
 localforage.removeItem("filename.txt") // delete a file
 localforage.clear() // delete all files from IndexedDB
 localforage.keys().then(function(files){/* do something with files*/}) // returns an array of all files stored in IndexedDB 

!!IndexedDB (Async)
 $db.set("file.txt", "hello world") // create a file
 $db.del("file.txt") // delete a file
 $db.clear() // delete all files from IndexedDB
 $db.getRaw("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the RAW file content
 $db.get("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the file content, if JSON, returns the parsed result
 $db.keys(callback) // callback() returns null and an array of files stored in IndexedDB

!!localStorage (Sync)
 $store.set('desktop/meme.txt', 'hello world'); // create meme.txt in desktop
 $store.get("desktop/meme.txt") // returns 
 $store.clear() // delete all files from localStorage
 $store.getRaw('desktop/meme.txt') // read file meme.txt in desktop
 $store.del("desktop/meme.txt") // delete a file
 $store.keys() // returns all files saved into localStorage

 $explorer.refresh() // refresh explorer
 $archive('/folder/name')  // put the contents of the folder into a zipped archive that you can download, does not always work on folders in /c/

My army, this place is NOT for doxxing or spamming random sh1t, it's a Wiki for you: the community. If you want cyber wars, enjoy trollbox. We would like to keep this place in peace for knowledge sharing. If you know the password (means that your are part of the community somehow) it gives you some special power but also some responsabilities. I don't want to ban people from windows93 or close the wiki, but as the worst admin ever I would delete the all website rather than loose a cyber battle.

Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.

Typing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93, while typing "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
Typing "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.
Typing "__discord__" will disconnect you from Trollbox. 

There's also an unused filter that is supposed to make "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been disabled.

Refreshing the page the trollbox messages are cleared.

When spamming in trollbox it should contain lot of people like about 1000, and needs be ban hammered your ip.

Closing window lot of people are left because they closed the window. Contains spam.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.

Typing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93, while typing "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
Typing "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.
Typing "__discord__" will disconnect you from Trollbox. 

There's also an unused filter that is supposed to make "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been disabled.

Refreshing the page the trollbox messages are cleared.

When spamming in trollbox it should contain lot of people like about 1000, and needs be ban hammered your ip.

Closing window lot of people are left because they closed the window. Contains spam.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

page:Trollbox Bots date:20191126170451 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of November 4th, 2019, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
?help,
ALBOT 2,
DudeBot V2,
Korrake (only can be seen when user Jayce is in trollbox),
discbot,
kay,
markov,
Gayleb.

!!!Here is a list of former bots:
ALBOT, 
HugBot
Welcome!,
canada,
europe,
TorBot/1024/MOBIUS (remodeled, now ?help),
kat,
fBot/Faggot/Troolbot™,
BONZIBOT,
j.help,
⚠️,
6pointoh,
free,
justin biebot/pedobear,
wAIfu,
echo,
elizabot,
Caleb.

!!Example code
{{{
const socket = require("socket.io-client")("http://windows93.net:8081");
const io = require('socket.io-client');
 
const sock = io("http://www.windows93.net:8081", {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transportOptions: {
    polling: {
      extraHeaders: {
        "Origin": "http://www.windows93.net",
        "Referer": "http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php"
      }
    }
  }
})
 
sock.on('connect', function(){
    sock.emit("user joined", "BotTemplate", "white");
})
 
sock.on('message', function(data){
    if(data.msg.startsWith('@template')){
       sock.emit('message', 'template')
    }
})
}}}

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

page:Windows93 v1 date:20191126172056 content:!Windows93 Version 1
[Windows93 v1|http://v1.windows93.net/] is the first functioning version of Windows93. It does not have storage, but it does have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

There is also an app named "WIN93TOUR simulator" which is a simulation game that is missing in [v2|Windows93 v2] for some reason. However, in [v2|Windows93 v2], inside "/c/programs" there is still the "euroDrunkSimulator" folder, which contains a non-functioning version of the game.

This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
If you're wondering why these are banned: 

*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username ip:204.126.11.231

>When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.
It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

It also has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message.

However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

On other browsers backgrounds and taskbars dont appear but icons is still appearing.

Near the end of June it was taken down after a notice published by Jankenpopp, to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again and hopefully it will stay that way.

Unfortunately the password to edit the wiki was leaked onto the board (most possibly from the same person who leaked it on trollbox) and inundated the wiki with spam and shitposts...

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of February 7th, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
ALBOT 2,
DudeBot V2,
Korrake (only can be seen when user Jayce is in trollbox),
discbot,
kay,

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

__DOSBox__ is an emulator program which emulates an __IBM PC compatible__ computer running a __DOS__ operating system. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided with an environment in which they can run correctly, even though the modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. 

__Windows93's DOSBox__ comes with programing tools, game creation tools, music softwares and games. It also emulates the PC98 japanese computer.

_Official [JS-DOS|https://js-dos.com] emulator doesn't allow data saving, but Windows93 use the archive.org DOSBox fork that allow users to save data in the local storage._

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."

!Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC

"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

!1914 translation by H. Rackham

"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

!Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC

"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

!1914 translation by H. Rackham

"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains." ip:77.129.105.121

StarWars.avi is an AVI file located on the desktop of Windows 93. It is a complete recreation of Episode IV of Star Wars: A New Hope, made entirely out of ASCII characters. There is no sound, and spoken words are represented simply by text. This "asciimation" was created by [www.asciimation.co.nz]. There are even controls for the movie in the bottom left corner.

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.

# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.

Typing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93, while typing "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
Typing "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.
Typing "__discord__" will disconnect you from Trollbox. 

There's also an unused filter that is supposed to make "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been disabled.

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

Near the end of June it was taken down after a notice published by Jankenpopp, to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again and hopefully it will stay that way.

Unfortunately the password to edit the wiki was leaked onto the board (most possibly from the same person who leaked it on trollbox) and inundated the wiki with spam and shitposts...

Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.

Typing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93, while typing "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
Typing "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.
Typing "__discord__" will disconnect you from Trollbox. Typing "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox. Typing "__FUTUR1993__" will send "•••••••••" instead.

There's also an unused filter that is supposed to make "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been disabled.

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

This is the 93 Realms wiki: https://93-realms.fandom.com/wiki/93_Realms_Wiki

[Windows93 v1|http://v1.windows93.net/] is the first functioning version of Windows93. It does not have storage, but it does have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

There is also an app named "WIN93TOUR simulator" which is a simulation game that is missing in [v2|Windows93 v2] for some reason. However, in [v2|Windows93 v2], inside "/c/programs" there is still the "euroDrunkSimulator" folder, which contains a non-functioning version of the game.

>When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.
It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

It also has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message.

However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

On other browsers backgrounds and taskbars dont appear but icons is still appearing.

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of February 17th, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

The @@open@@ function returns the contents of a URL in a specified form.

!! Usage
    $file.open(filePath, form, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@form@@ - The type/class the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however <code>'String'</code> will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!! Examples
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of <code>/a/README.txt</code> as a string, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of <code>/a/README.txt</code> as a Blob's object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of <code>/a/trash/trash.jpg</code> as an ArrayBuffer, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!! Usefulness
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as ArrayBuffers and URLs in a single function. ip:162.212.197.193

Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.


Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* If you say "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of astericks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's was also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

Windows93 apps are categorized according to the [Freedesktop category specification|https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html]. The most prominent of these categories in Windows93 are Utilities, Games, and Viewers, or openers.

!! Openers
Openers are any program that can open files, files are always passed to the app by their path.

!! CLI Apps
There are many apps which the majority users don't even directly interact with. This takes the form of Terminal commands, and includes the following:
* reboot - Reloads the window
* format - "Reinstalls" Windows93
* fullscreen - Puts the window into fullscreen mode: immersive.
* shutdown - "Shuts down" Windows93. It is now safe to turn off your computer.
* pwd - Displays the current directory.
* cd - Changes the current directory.
* ls - Lists all items in the current directory.
* find - Searches the current directory and all child directories for a specified file.
* tree - Displays the structure of a specified directory, and all child directories.
* help - Displays all apps.
* clear - Clears the Terminal
* history - Displays all previous commands
* clearhist - Clears all terminal history. Sorry, not your search history too.
* win - Displays all open windows; mapping their ID to their name.
* key - Allows you to get the keycode and name of any entered key.
* info - Displays some info about Windows93 and your browser.
* killlall - Closes all windows.

page:$file API date:20200228010214 content:! $file 
$file is a global API for interacting with Windows93's file system. It has several utility functions which can aid in almost all of an app's interactions with the file system.


!! $file.getUrl 
The @@getUrl@@ function returns a created Object URL for the file's [Blob|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob] form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.getUrl(filePath, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the Object URL

!!! Example 
    $file.getUrl('/a/trash/trash.jpg', $log)
Retrieve the file @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@, and print it's Object URL in the terminal.

!!! Usefulness 
This is functionally the same as invoking @@$file.open@@ with @@'URL'@@ as the form, but it's shorter and slightly faster; in the end it's up to preference.


!! $file.open 
The @@open@@ function returns the contents of a file in a specified form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.open(filePath, form, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@form@@ - A string representing the form the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however @@'String'@@ will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!!! Examples 
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@String@@, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@Blob@@'s object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@ as an @@ArrayBuffer@@, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!!! Usefulness 
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as @@ArrayBuffers@@ and URLs in a single function.


!! $file.iterateFolder 
The @@iterateFolder@@ function runs a callback for every child file of a directory, passing the file's path.

!!! Usage 
    $file.iterateFolder(directoryPath, callback)
Where
* @@directoryPath@@ - A string containing the directory's path
* @@callback@@ - The function to be invoked with the file paths

XMAS mode is a Windows 93 event that will trigger every year at the 23th of December.

_NOTE: It didn't trigger in 2017._

In XMAS mode your Windows 93 screen will have snowflakes and the background will change to a random pic from http://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/xmas/bg/

There is also a pop-up message that appears when you boot-up Windows 93

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510889725779902464/526704092052193280/unknown.png)) 

v1 had a different boot-up logo

page:Trollbox Bots date:20200228113758 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down and destroy your ram

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of February 17th, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
ALBOT 2,
DudeBot V2,
Gayleb,
12bot.

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

page:Trollbox Bots date:20200229092334 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of February 17th, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
ALBOT 2,
DudeBot V2,
Gayleb,
12bot.

!!!Here is a list of former bots:
ALBOT, 
‌‌♡‌H‌‌ugB‌‌‌‌‌o‌‌‌t‌‌♡,
Welcome!,
canada(c!help),
europe(e!help),
TorBot/1024/MOBIUS/?help,

fBot/Faggot/Troolbot™,
BONZIBOT,

6pointoh,
free,
justin biebot/pedobear,
wAIfu,
echo,
elizabot,
Caleb,
Korrake,

!!Example code
{{{
const socket = require("socket.io-client")("http://windows93.net:8081");
const io = require('socket.io-client');
 
const sock = io("http://www.windows93.net:8081", {
  path: '/socket.io',
  transportOptions: {
    polling: {
      extraHeaders: {
        "Origin": "http://www.windows93.net",
        "Referer": "http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php"
      }
    }
  }
})
 
sock.on('connect', function(){
    sock.emit("user joined", "BotTemplate", "white");
})
 
sock.on('message', function(data){
    if(data.msg.startsWith('@template')){
       sock.emit('message', 'template')
    }
})
}}}

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

page:Trollbox date:20200229093003 content:!Trollbox
Trollbox is a chat in [v2|Windows93 v2], known as Clavardage (french for "chat") on the desktop. It can also be accessed directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/]. Currently it does not work over HTTPS.

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__". The image below shows the output

((https://i.imgur.com/uWJ1M7p.jpg))
   
# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.

The /mlg command is removed.


Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of astericks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's was also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

So far we have given you a common __open password__ that you could find on your own by solving a riddle.
We thought it was a fun idea to give the password like this and that people would have felt responsible for the content.

While most users have played the game by keeping the pass secret and posting quality articles, this was sadly not the case for everyone. The wiki has been vandalized three times by random thots who think they are greatosti hackers. __Sad times__.

Some users here still don't get that windows93.net is an free and independent project run/dev/moderate by just two persons, we take a lot of our free time to offer you all this stuff. Each time we have to fix your bullshit we loose some precious time that we could use to offer you more content.

!!Anyway, now only trusted users will get a pass :3 
You can request a password to me (janken) via mail or discord, if I know you I'll give you a pass. If I don't know you or don't trust you, I'll probably ignore your demand.

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200229115322 content:So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) { // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
    if (args[1] === undefined) { // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
      socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.") // send an error message.
      return; // and then end the command here.
    }
    
    n1 = Number(args[0]); // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
    n2 = Number(args[1]);
    
    sum = (n1 + n2).toString(); // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.
    
    socket.emit('message', sum) // send the sum!

__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {

socket.emit('message','TEXT') emits a message
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200229122000 content:So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).toString();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}

Trollbox++ is an alternative trollbox server, originally developed by 1024x2. This clone has extra features, such as admin functions.

Trollbox++ v1 was developed by just 1024x2, however Trollbox++ v2 is also being developed by DarkOK.

At the moment, Trollbox++ is on a hiatus, due to no need for a custom Trollbox server at the moment.

((http://www.windows93.net/b/src/1582800173247.png|nope|R)) 
So far we have given you a common __open password__ that you could find on your own by solving a riddle.
We thought it was a fun idea to give the password like this and that people would have felt responsible for the content.

While most users have played the game by keeping the pass secret and posting quality articles, this was sadly not the case for everyone. The wiki has been vandalized three times by random thots who think they are greatosti hackers. __Sad times__.

Some users here still don't get that windows93.net is a free and independent project run/dev/moderate by just two persons, we take a lot of our free time to offer you all this stuff. Each time we have to fix your bullshit we loose some precious time that we could use to offer you more content.

!!Anyway, now only trusted users will get a pass :3 
__You can request a password__ to me (janken) via mail or discord, if I know you I'll give you a pass. If I don't know you or don't trust you, I'll probably ignore your demand.

💖 Forever yours, Janken. ip:77.130.93.157

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200301000700 content:So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).toString();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200301005632 content:So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

!Things to point out
!!1. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!2. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!3. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200301023846 content:So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).toString();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of March 1st, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
- Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with [v2|Windows93 v2]. 

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|oh yeah))

On the desktop, its icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat") before to get its definitive name. 

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 


!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor [text] - aesthetics text
# /wrap [text] - wrap text in flourish
# /mess [text] - mess text
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /who - List users by [home] 
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of astericks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's was also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

!!!As of March 1st, 2020, this is the list of bots on Trollbox:
- Tree's Tree (lw82's bot),
- ALBOT 2
- DudeBot V2

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

System 42, or sys42.js is a collection of APIs and utilites used by Windows 93. 

While it's mainly used by Windows 93, it can be used in other environments for some useful APIs.

There is also sys42 v3, which is meant to be a framework for Windows 93 v3. As of 1/3/20 it is 75% completed.

All sys42 APIs, with the exception of @@system42()@@ begin with $.

page:$file date:20200302061244 content:! $file 
The $file global is an API for interacting with Windows93's file system. It has several utility functions which can aid in almost all of an app's interactions with the file system.


!! $file.getUrl 
The @@getUrl@@ function returns a created Object URL for the file's [Blob|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob] form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.getUrl(filePath, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the Object URL

!!! Example 
    $file.getUrl('/a/trash/trash.jpg', $log)
Retrieve the file @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@, and print it's Object URL in the terminal.

!!! Usefulness 
This is functionally the same as invoking @@$file.open@@ with @@'URL'@@ as the form, but it's shorter and slightly faster; in the end it's up to preference.


!! $file.open 
The @@open@@ function returns the contents of a file in a specified form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.open(filePath, form, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@form@@ - A string representing the form the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however @@'String'@@ will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!!! Examples 
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@String@@, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@Blob@@'s object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@ as an @@ArrayBuffer@@, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!!! Usefulness 
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as @@ArrayBuffers@@ and URLs in a single function.


!! $file.iterateFolder 
The @@iterateFolder@@ function runs a callback for every child file of a directory, passing the file's path.

!!! Usage 
    $file.iterateFolder(directoryPath, callback)
Where
* @@directoryPath@@ - A string containing the directory's path
* @@callback@@ - The function to be invoked with the file paths

Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isnt
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm install socket.io@@. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!

There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isnt
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm install socket.io@@. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!

Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
onst io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.

Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works.

Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
onst io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (message === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (message.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message," "bar!")
  }

  if (message.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

page:harry93 date:20200308021351 content:🔧 harry93 (h:) (or just "harry93") is a new (as of 01/03/20) [Trollbox] bot that runs on NodeJS, created by Harry.

!Commands
All of the following commands use the prefix "h:".
- help - displays a list of usable commands.
- roll <nds> - rolls some dice where n is the number of dice being rolled and s being the number of sides on each dice.
- utctime - shows the time in UTC.
- bottime - shows the time for where the bot is being hosted.
- add2 <n1> <n2> - adds two numbers together.
- colourwheel - outputs a random colour from an array.
- awesome - shows a link to [this page|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Trollbox%20Bot%20Awesome].
- 8ball <question> - predicts the future based on the question. the question must start with "will" or "what are the chances of" to work.
- send <message> - allows you to send a message from Trollbox to Discord and vice versa.
- manifesto - functions just like the MANIFESTO program but with a bit more pizazz.

!Trivia
- Every 2 minutes, harry93 says a random string of text taken from a file name "text.json".
- harry93 sometimes responds to messages that aren't commands.
- Harry lives with the bot in Australia. Thus, the bot time's timezone is AEST.
- "if harry93 was a real android, it would give me hugs every time it saw me" -Harry
- harry93 looks like [this|https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683178867678117908/683575784660533249/harry93.png].
- harry93, like harry, identifies as nonbinary.
- There is an official Discord server for harry93. You can join it [here|https://discord.gg/7VByskt].
- harry93 is also a Discord bot at the same time, however not all of the commands have been ported over yet.

!Windows
#Install [NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] and Visual Studio Code.
#Make a folder.
#Open Visual Studio Code and go to file -> open folder
#Open your new folder.
#Go to terminal -> new terminal
#Use command prompt
#Insert __npm init__ in the terminal and fill a form, you can leave everthing blank
#Insert __npm install socket.io-client__ in the terminal
#Make a file named index.js and add code (said in code section) and dont forget to ??save!|Ctrl+S??
#To start the bot (after you coded commands), go in the terminal you launched earlier and write __node index__ 
!Code
__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this

socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname
   //data.color is the color
})
}}}

Example of command (to put inside the socket.on seen previously):
{{{
if (data.msg.toLowerCase().startsWith("£help")) {
      socket.emit('message','Here are the commands: Here write your list of commands')
}
}}}

page:How to make a Trollbox bot v2 date:20200309054857 content:!Introduction
Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

_Note: This tutorial is only for people who run Windows and already have at least a basic understanding on how things work. If you don't know what the Command Prompt is or anything like that, come back to this tutorial later.

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io-client@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (data.msg === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (data.msg.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message", "bar!")
  }

  if (data.msg.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

_Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

_Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

!Random messages every so often

Before we get it to say random things, we need to make a list of random things to say! To do this, we can use an external JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file.

With JSON files, we can store large amounts of numbers, strings, and arrays so it doesn't clog up the main bot file.

{{{
{ // even though json doesn't support commenting, i still would like to mention that curly braces are used to open and close the whole file. you can think of a json file as a lua list almost!
   "funnyNumber": 7,
   "niceGirl": "kailey",
   "distros": [
      "ubuntu",
      "mint",
      "arch",
      "fedora",
      "debian"
   ],
   "player": {
      "x": 53,
      "y": 315
   }      
}
}}}
So for our @@text.json@@, we can create an array called @@quotes@@ or @@random_stuff@@ if you want.
{{{
{
  "quotes": [
    "trans rights are human rights!",
    "every user in this room is real...except me.",
    "kailey is an amazing girl. please send her hugs!",
    "make trollbox friendly again!",
    "jet set radioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
    "be nice, alright?"
  ]
}
}}}
And now, back in our @@index.js@@ file, we can import the JSON file similarly to how you would import a module.
{{{
const text = require('./text.json') // here's our json file!
const moment = require('moment')
const io = require('socket.io-client')
...
}}}
Now that we have our random things, let's make our bot say these things!
!!The actual code behind it
All you have to do is use a @@setInterval();@@ function to make your bot execute code over and over again after a, well, set interval!
{{{
// you can put this line of code just about anywhere in your file. i keep mine at the bottom so it's not in the way.
setInterval(function(){
	socket.emit('message', text.quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*text.quotes.length-1)]) // this line may look familiar. notice how we call the quotes by using "text.quotes".
}, 120000) // this number determines the interval in milliseconds. in this case, its for 2 minutes. you can set this number to whatever you want but i strongly advise to set the interval to over a minute or your bot might become a bit spammy.
}}}
And that's it! Your bot will now say something random every so often!

Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

!Random messages every so often (feat. JSON files!)
_Requested by Ant on Trollbox!_
If you've been on Trollbox for at least 5-10 minutes, you've probably noticed that [harry93] and Gayleb say random things every so often without anyone doing anything. The code behind this interesting feature is actually quite simple. Let me show you!

>__ _DISCLAIMER: The misuse of the following code can get your bot shut down by Jankenpopp and will probably force me to remove this section from the page. So, if you're planning on using this code in your bot, use it responsibly and don't ruin it for everyone else!_ __

!!Getting the list together
Before we get it to say random things, we need to make a list of random things to say! To do this, we can use an external JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. So, in your bot folder, create a new file and call it @@text.json@@. It doesn't have to be called @@text@@, but its extension needs to be @@.json@@. With JSON files, we can store large amounts of numbers, strings, and arrays so it doesn't clog up the main bot file.
{{{
{ // even though json doesn't support commenting, i still would like to mention that curly braces are used to open and close the whole file. you can think of a json file as a lua list almost!
   "funnyNumber": 7,
   "niceGirl": "kailey",
   "distros": [
      "ubuntu",
      "mint",
      "arch",
      "fedora",
      "debian"
   ],
   "player": {
      "x": 53,
      "y": 315
   }      
}
}}}
So for our @@text.json@@, we can create an array called @@quotes@@ or @@random_stuff@@ if you want.
{{{
{
  "quotes": [
    "trans rights are human rights!",
    "every user in this room is real...except me.",
    "kailey is an amazing girl. please send her hugs!",
    "make trollbox friendly again!",
    "jet set radioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
    "be nice, alright?"
  ]
}
}}}
And now, back in our @@index.js@@ file, we can import the JSON file similarly to how you would import a module.
{{{
const text = require('./text.json') // here's our json file!
const moment = require('moment')
const io = require('socket.io-client')
...
}}}
Now that we have our random things, let's make our bot say these things!
!!The actual code behind it
All you have to do is use a @@setInterval();@@ function to make your bot execute code over and over again after a, well, set interval!
{{{
// you can put this line of code just about anywhere in your file. i keep mine at the bottom so it's not in the way.
setInterval(function(){
	socket.emit('message', text.quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*text.quotes.length-1)]) // this line may look familiar. notice how we call the quotes by using "text.quotes".
}, 120000) // this number determines the interval in milliseconds. in this case, its for 2 minutes. you can set this number to whatever you want but i strongly advise to set the interval to over a minute or your bot might become a bit spammy.
}}}
And that's it! Your bot will now say something random every so often!

page:How to make a Trollbox bot v2 date:20200309083947 content:!Introduction
Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

>Note: This tutorial is only for people who run Windows and already have at least a basic understanding on how things work. If you don't know what the Command Prompt is or anything like that, come back to this tutorial later.

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io-client@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (data.msg === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (data.msg.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message", "bar!")
  }

  if (data.msg.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200309085404 content:!Introduction
So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

>Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":

}}}
!!Using moment

      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones

page:Trollbox Bots date:20200320230022 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's prefix, like "bot, " in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

Probably coming soon, probably won't

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

You can find a list of all the current bots [here|List of active Trollbox bots].

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

page:Get started with a Trollbox bot date:20200405172346 content:If I had looked at Trollbox bots as a beginner, I would have loved to be shown the basics, to then be able to upgrade and make my own research. Trollbox bots are coded in a programming language called JavaScript, abbreviated to JS. There are other tutorials on the same matter here, but I found them to be more pointed towards people with a basic knowledge, compared to a total starter. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make JS code launchable on your PC, create a folder with your creations, install modules, connect your bot to the trollbox and a whole lot more. Let's start!

!JS basics
!!Data types you need to know

String: Basically text. In js, you represent it by putting the text between quotation marks.
{{{
var a = "abcdef"@@
}}}

Number: Self-explanatory
{{{
var b = 4
}}}

Array: A list of values, often strings. You make one by placing strings, separating them by commas and putting brackets.
{{{
var c = ["a", "b", "c"]
}}}

Boolean: True or false. 1 or 0. On or off. Can only take two values: True or false
{{{
var d = true
}}}

!!Constant or variable?
Constants and variables are what we use to stock data types. The difference is that constants can't be changed through the code, while variables can.
We declare constants by using _const_, and variables generally by _var_.
{{{
const a = "abc"
const a = "def" // That will make an error and crash your bot
var b = "abc"
var b = "def" //This works fine, the var will now be "def". 
}}}

And that's all you need to know for the moment! Of course, you are expected to try to make your own researchs down the road as you progress, but if you understand what has been written above, it's superb.

!Setting up the work environment.
Here are three things that you will need:
- Administrative permissions on your PC. If your parents have locked your session in a Standard User, you will have to stop this tutorial right here;
- Node.JS;
- A text editor. Most people use Notepad++ or Atom. I'll use Notepad++ in the example.

!Tutorial
For the rest of the tutorial, I will include a visual support which will take the format of a YouTube video.
__Watch the video before copying the code below, it will help you understand JS. Furthermore, please do not copy this code (except the connection part, of course), only use it as a reference.__

page:Meme date:20200406083414 content:!Meme

A _meme_ is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to GENES in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. The word meme is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book « The Selfish Gene ». The word meme is a shortening (modeled on GENE) of MImeme (from Ancient Greek: "imitated thing").

((http://www.windows93.net/b/src/1586160785872.gif))

_The associated image "Kilroy was here" was a graffito that became popular in the 1940s, and existed under various names in different countries, illustrating how a meme can be modified through replication. This is seen as one of the first widespread memes in the world._

!! Richard Dawkins
((https://ozlusozluk.com/yazar-resimleri/722/richard-dawkins.jpg|richard-dawkins)) 

Richard Dawkins (born 26 March 1941) is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and author. Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and introduced the term _meme_.

!Internet meme
An _Internet meme_, more commonly known simply as a meme, is a type of meme which is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms. Colloquially, the term may also refer specifically to pieces of media that take the general format of such memes, traditionally but not exclusively combining image macros with a concept or catchphrase. These traditional types of memes can be very simplistic, often featuring a single word or phrase. In some cases these words and phrases contain intentional misspellings (such as lolcats) or incorrect grammar (such as doge and "All your base are belong to us"). However, in more recent times, memes have evolved from simple image macros with text to more elaborate things such as challenges, GIFs and viral sensations. These small movements tend to spread from person to person via social networks, blogs, direct email, or news sources. They may relate to various existing Internet cultures or subcultures, often created or spread on various websites. Fads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet because the instant communication facilitates word of mouth transmission. Some examples include posting a photo of people lying down in public places (called "planking") and uploading a short video of people doing the Harlem Shake.

A minesweeper-like program.
!!How To Play
First, go into the menu (you will see a thing that says game). Then, go to Options and turn troll mode off. Then play like minesweeper! You can change the difficulty via menu.
!!Trivia
-You can't resize the window, but changing the grid automatically does it.
-There is an unused feature of a high-score.
-F2 restarts it.
-The credits are in the menu, Help > About
-If you places all the flags, the flags remaining will go blue. When it's blue, you can click it to see if they are correct.
-You can click a tile with all of the flags around it marked to click everything else around it.
-There is a bug in troll mode where you can place a flag, click it, then click anywhere else and it might not be a mine.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).
What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page does not filter HTML elements, which can allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website. (try it: open cat explorer and go to http://utf-16.ovh/catex/ ).
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.
... and probably many more.

Using Windows 93 JS functions, you can make your own Program, just run the function in terminal or the js console, seperate the functions with a ;
>$exe("trollbox"); $alert("i launched trollbox");
This page contains some basic Windows93 JS functions you can use in your program.

!!Executing programs
>$exe("program")

This is used to open a program. Any app that is installed on windows93.

!!Showing dialogs.
>$alert("text")

It is used to show a dialog box. Can be customized.

!!Showing notifications
>$notif("text")

Use me for notifications.

!!Managing Windows™
>$window("url")

There is another variant: @@$window.form@@

!!/a/ Storage
>@@$db.set("folder/file.txt", "hello world!")@@

This is used to manage files and folders.

!Original article
If I had looked at Trollbox bots as a beginner, I would have loved to be shown the basics, to then be able to upgrade and make my own research. Trollbox bots are coded in a programming language called JavaScript, abbreviated to JS. There are other tutorials on the same matter here, but I found them to be more pointed towards people with a basic knowledge, compared to a total starter. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to make JS code launchable on your PC, create a folder with your creations, install modules, connect your bot to the trollbox and a whole lot more. Let's start!

!JS basics
!!Data types you need to know

String: Basically text. In js, you represent it by putting the text between quotation marks.
{{{
var a = "abcdef"
}}}

Number: Self-explanatory
{{{
var b = 4
}}}

Array: A list of values, often strings. You make one by placing strings, separating them by commas and putting brackets.
{{{
var c = ["a", "b", "c"]
}}}

Boolean: True or false. 1 or 0. On or off. Can only take two values: True or false
{{{
var d = true
}}}

!!Constant or variable?
Constants and variables are what we use to stock data types. The difference is that constants can't be changed through the code, while variables can.
We declare constants by using _const_, and variables generally by _var_.
{{{
const a = "abc"
const a = "def" // That will make an error and crash your bot
var b = "abc"
var b = "def" //This works fine, the var will now be "def". 
}}}

And that's all you need to know for the moment! Of course, you are expected to try to make your own researchs down the road as you progress, but if you understand what has been written above, it's superb.

!Setting up the work environment.
Here are three things that you will need:
- Administrative permissions on your PC. If you are not the owner of the PC you are using and you are a Standard User on the computer, we can't do anything (legal) for you, you will have to stop this tutorial right here;
- Node.JS;
- A text editor. Most people use Notepad++, Atom or VSC. I'll use Notepad++ in the example.

!Tutorial
For the rest of the tutorial, I will include a visual support which will take the format of a YouTube video.
__Watch the video before copying the code below, it will help you understand JS. Furthermore, please do not copy this code (except the connection part, of course), only use it as a reference.__

- On "/" in the explorer, you have the option do download /b/ but it produces an error.
- When you resize a window from top top to bottom or left to right too much, it can make it move.
- In [Brian Sweeper|Minesweeper||minesweeper app for windows93], you can win troll mode. To do this, place a flag then click on it. This is now a mine, and other spots should be safe.
- In Solitude, you can drag a card on the top stack even if there are cards underneath it. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card off the screen, making it scroll. Infinite scrolling

((https://i.imgur.com/UY5C12Z.png|Solitude glitching|R))
Solitude is [a|a] game you play exactly like Solitare, but without points or difficulty. The red cards are now pink to look more link [Windows93's|Windows93||you fucking idiot you know what it is] color spectrum. Once you get all cards to the top, they rain down one by one. In the menu, there is a "Yeah" option. This is different from winning as now you drag to rain down cards. Solitude is known for being buggy (see picture on right), all known bugs are listed [here|List of Bugs||ok gotta be honest it has more then solitude bugs]. 
!!Trivia
*In V1, cards had no pointer cursor when hovered over.
*You used to not be able to win in V1. ⁽ᶜᵒⁿᶠᶦʳᵐᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾
*V1 had no close option in the menu.
*Solitude's name is based off of solitare (the card game) and solitude (lonely) ip:50.196.188.89

page:The Catex Bug date:20200612111215 content:! ((/c/sys/skins/w93/apps/catexplorer.png)) The Catex Bug
The Catex (Cat Explorer) bug is a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/#!/c/programs/catExplorer/] file on windows93. It was discovered by utf-4096 on 06/05/2020.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page does not filter HTML elements, which can allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website. (try it: open cat explorer and go to http://utf-16.ovh/catex/ ).
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.
... and probably many more.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with [v2|Windows93 v2]. 

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|oh yeah))

On the desktop, its icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat") before to get its definitive name. 

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

It doesn't use a database, not like a [earlier chat|https://imgur.com/eLLhyPZ] from [Windows93 v2 beta] which was running on Terminal. Instead, it uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 


!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor [text] - aesthetics text
# /wrap [text] - wrap text in flourish
# /mess [text] - mess text
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /who - List users by [home] 
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

__AND YES, THE PEOPLE ARE REAL.__

Solitude is a game you play exactly like Solitare, but without points or difficulty. The red cards are now pink to look more link [Windows93]'s color spectrum. Once you get all cards to the top, they rain down one by one. In the menu, there is a "Yeah" option. This is different from winning as now you drag to rain down cards. Solitude is known for being buggy (see picture on right), all known bugs are listed [here|List of Bugs||ok gotta be honest it has more then solitude bugs]. 
!!Trivia
*In V1, cards had no pointer cursor when hovered over.
*You used to not be able to win in V1. ⁽ᶜᵒⁿᶠᶦʳᵐᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ⁾
*V1 had no close option in the menu.
*Solitude's name is based off of solitare (the card game) and solitude (lonely) ip:2a00:23c6:a02:ef00:7285:c2ff:fe6d:9816

[Windows93 v1|http://v1.windows93.net/] is the first functioning version of Windows93. It does not have storage, but it does have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

There is also an app named "WIN93TOUR simulator" which is a simulation game that is missing in [v2|Windows93 v2] for some reason. However, in [v2|Windows93 v2], inside "/c/programs" there is still the "euroDrunkSimulator" folder, which contains a non-functioning version of the game.

page:Windows93 v1 date:20200913185705 content:[Windows93 v1|http://v1.windows93.net/] is the first functioning version of Windows93. It does not have storage, but it does have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

There is also an app named "WIN93TOUR simulator" which is a simulation game that was missing in [v2|Windows93 v2] for a while. However, in [v2|Windows93 v2], inside "/c/programs" there was still the "euroDrunkSimulator" folder, which contains a non-functioning version of the game.

- Making an explorer or catex window to small makes the search feature go out of the window
- The selection produced from an explorer window by dragging its body can go out of the window.
- On "/" in the explorer, you have the option do download /b/ but it produces an error.
- When you resize a window from top top to bottom or left to right too much, it can make it move.
- When you open an app on the terminal, then all apps after that that are opened with a terminal will have the same icon and title as the first one.
- Windows with FX on them have no closing animations.
- When you press enter while making a shortcut, it opens the icon window instead of making the shortcut (more of an oversight)
- Moving a folder into another folder erases all of the document's text that are in that folder.
- Applying some FX to a window (like anogram, vhs, and vh2) makes a white box around it.
- Adding a shortcut, opening the edit menu for it, deleting the shortcut, changing the icon, and trying to apply those changes makes an error and an unclosable window.
- In [trollbox|Trollbox], when /emo is on, saying things like @@")@@ or @@<)@@ show an emoji when it shouldn't.
- In trollbox, if you have /l337 or /reverse on, some other built in commands don't work.
- Kof93 has an effect that can make some processers produce a faint beep even when sound is turned off.'
- Pressing start in defrag multiple times will duplicate the sound.
- Minimizing a window multiple times by right clicking the dock and pressing "Minimize" multiple times slightly glitches the minimizing and unminimizing animation.

!!Solitude Bugs
- In [Solitude|Solitude], you can drag a card on the top stack even if there are cards underneath it. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card off the screen, making it scroll. Infinite scrolling
- In Solitude, you can click on cards at the bottom of the down-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag cards at the bottom of the top-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card on the top stack off and drag a card underneath it. You can do anything you want with the card underneath.
- In Solitude, you can still drag cards after the win screen appears.
- In Solitude, you can drag a card from the top of a stack and let go. Then drag the bottom card while it is going back to its original position. This should drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, do the previous bug but do it on a single card that is at the bottom of the stack. When you drag this card while it is sliding, the card above it should cling to your mouse and you can drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, the green circle that appears in the top left doesnt change your cursor despite being clickable.
- In Solitude, you can double click back facing cards and they sometimes move to the top stack. Any cards beneath it, including blue cards, will appear at the top stack.
- In Solitude, dragging the last card on the trash pile then clicking the green circle while it is still moving makes a down facing card move, which can never normally happen.
- In Solitude, after a legit win, drag a king on the main pile, then back up. Repeat this a lot, and you get more cards coming out than there should.
- In Solitude, drag an ace to the top stack. Instead of letting go, quickly move your mouse out of the window. If the pink card spot underneath is still highlighted, let go of your mouse before going back in the window. The pink spot will still be highlighted without anything on it.
- In Solitude, drag a card, and drag a card that can be placed on it on the first card. If the card you first dragged is highlighted but the second card isn't on it, let go. The first card should stay highlighted without anything on it. ip:50.196.188.89

page:Trollbox Bots date:20200913190621 content:!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's help command, like "[!help]" in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

___You need headers for a trollbox bot at the moment. If you can't figure that out, you aren't good enough of a programmer to make one.___

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

You can find a list of all the current bots [here|List of active Trollbox bots].

!!!Here is a list of former bots:

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

 localforage.keys().then(function(files){/* do something with files*/}) // returns an array of all files stored in IndexedDB 

!!IndexedDB (Async)
 $db.set("file.txt", "hello world") // create a file
 $db.del("file.txt") // delete a file
 $db.clear() // delete all files from IndexedDB
 $db.getRaw("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the RAW file content
 $db.get("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the file content, if JSON, returns the parsed result
 $db.keys(callback) // callback() returns null and an array of files stored in IndexedDB

!!localStorage (Sync)
 $store.set('desktop/meme.txt', 'hello world'); // create meme.txt in desktop
 $store.get("desktop/meme.txt") // returns 
 $store.clear() // delete all files from localStorage
 $store.getRaw('desktop/meme.txt') // read file meme.txt in desktop
 $store.del("desktop/meme.txt") // delete a file

__DOSBox__ is an emulator program which emulates an __IBM PC compatible__ computer running a __DOS__ operating system. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided with an environment in which they can run correctly, even though the modern computers have dropped support for that old environment.

;What is this?:This is a wiki, a website on which users collaboratively modify content and structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language. This website uses something similar to MediaWiki's markup language, called ??wr93|Wiki Renderer 93??.

;How do I make changes to the wiki?:In order to make changes, you need to be trusted in the eyes of Jankenpopp. More info [here|?].

;How do I edit the navbar on the left?:The contents of the navbar are stored [here|Menu].

;How do I upload images to the wiki to use on pages?:You can't upload images directly to the wiki, but you can upload images to a website like [imgur|imgur.com] and then link them on pages.

;Why was the home page uneditable?:The home page of the wiki used to be uneditable due to the risk of it being destroyed and changed constantly. But now that the wiki is now only editable by trusted users, this isn't an issue anymore. ip:2a00:23c6:a02:ef00:7285:c2ff:fe6d:9816

page:The Leto Beta Appstore Incident date:20200913202731 content:Basically there was an appstore beta. People found the link to it and we found the beta.

Then we dug in more, and found a mass mailer. Some troll abused it ofc, and then trollbox, bindowzuchan, the store, and wiki93 were shutdown.

A few days later, it all came back (not the store). Some people were banned, and windows93 simply gave _oof._

At 9/11/18, these bans were lifted. However the troll that caused all of this was never found.

The end..............__?__

!Trollbox++
((https://i.imgur.com/TlMLZIM.png|Trollbox++ v1|R))
Trollbox++ is an alternative trollbox server, originally developed by 1024x2. This clone has extra features, such as admin functions.

Trollbox++ v1 was developed by just 1024x2, however Trollbox++ v2 is also being developed by DarkOK.

At the moment, Trollbox++ is on a hiatus, due to no need for a custom Trollbox server at the moment.

page:Apps date:20200913204546 content:Windows93 has a number of apps which the user can launch from the desktop, or in the programs section of the start menu. Currently Windows93 has 101 apps in total; since they're what you'll be spending your time with most.

((https://i.imgur.com/fiPQyQX.png))

Codemirror, Catexplorer, and the Speech app all open at once.

! App Categories
Windows93 apps are categorized according to the [Freedesktop category specification|https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html]. The most prominent of these categories in Windows93 are Utilities, Games, and Viewers, or openers.

! Openers
Openers are any program that can open files, files are always passed to the app by their path.

! Terminal Apps
There are many apps which the majority users don't even directly interact with. This takes the form of Terminal commands, and includes the following:
* reboot - Reloads the window
* format - "Reinstalls" Windows93
* fullscreen - Puts the window into fullscreen mode: immersive.
* shutdown - "Shuts down" Windows93. It is now safe to turn off your computer.
* pwd - Displays the current directory.
* cd - Changes the current directory.
* ls - Lists all items in the current directory.
* find - Searches the current directory and all child directories for a specified file.
* tree - Displays the structure of a specified directory, and all child directories.
* help - Displays all apps.
* clear - Clears the Terminal
* history - Displays all previous commands

page:The Catex Bug date:20200913213316 content:! ((/c/sys/skins/w93/apps/catexplorer.png)) The Catex Bug
The Catex (Cat Explorer) bug was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93. ip:2a00:23c6:a02:ef00:7285:c2ff:fe6d:9816

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ is considered the heart of the Windows93 community.

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor [text] - aesthetics text
# /wrap [text] - wrap text in flourish
# /mess [text] - mess text
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /who - List users by [home] 
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called Messenger being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

Trollbox++ v1 was developed by just 1024x2, however Trollbox++ v2 is also being developed by DarkOK.

At the moment, Trollbox++ is on a hiatus, due to no need for a custom Trollbox server at the moment.

!Windows
#Install [NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] and Visual Studio Code.
#Make a folder.
#Open Visual Studio Code and go to file -> open folder
#Open your new folder.
#Go to terminal -> new terminal
#Use command prompt
#Insert __npm init__ in the terminal and fill a form, you can leave everthing blank
#Insert __npm install socket.io-client__ in the terminal
#Make a file named index.js and add code (said in code section) and dont forget to ??save!|Ctrl+S??
#To start the bot (after you coded commands), go in the terminal you launched earlier and write __node index__ 
!Code
__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
    path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){
    socket.emit('user joined', 'BOTNAME', 'BOTCOLOR:rgb, hex or CSS predefined colors')
})
}}}
Learn how socket.io-client works.

socket.emit('message','TEXT') emits a message
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname
   //data.color is the color
})
}}}

Example of command (to put inside the socket.on seen previously):
{{{
if (data.msg.toLowerCase().startsWith("£help")) {
      socket.emit('message','Here are the commands: Here write your list of commands')
}
}}}

Windows 93 is a website styled to look and work as an OS, often called a [Web OS]. It's developed by [Jankenpopp] and [Zombectro].
It features several [apps|Category apps] with memes mainly from the early 2000s. They are used to represent how the internet was during that time.

Windows 93 started when Jankenpopp proposed to Zombectro about working on a Web OS together.

!History
!!Version 0
The [version 0|Windows93 v0] was the prototype Janken sent Zombectro. It included basic windows and start menu.
!!Version 1
[Version 0|Windows93 v1] was the first true release of Windows 93, it added more functionality to windows and start menu and added a lot of meme apps. However, it wouldn't be until [V2|Windows93 v2] that local files would be added.
!!Version 2
Version 2 added a lot of features into Windows 93. Most notably the [A: drive|a] which would allow you to store files, run custom JS and apply custom CSS. It was around this time the social aspect of Windows 93 started with things like [Trollbox] and [Bindowzuchan]. Also because of the social aspect a community around Windows 93 started forming, sharing themes and custom apps among each other. ip:130.204.89.210

Windows 93 started when Jankenpopp proposed to Zombectro about working on a Web OS together.

The [version 0|Windows93 v0] was the prototype Janken sent Zombectro. It included basic windows and start menu.
!!Version 1
[Version 0|Windows93 v1] was the first true release of Windows 93, it added more functionality to windows and start menu and added a lot of meme apps. However, it wouldn't be until [V2|Windows93 v2] that local files would be added.
!!Version 2
Version 2 added a lot of features into Windows 93. Most notably the [A: drive|a] which would allow you to store files, run custom JS and apply custom CSS.

(Rework)

[Windows93 v1|http://v1.windows93.net/] is the first functioning version of Windows93. It does not have storage, but it does have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

There is also an app named "WIN93TOUR simulator" which is a simulation game that was missing in [v2|Windows93 v2] for a while. It is now back.

Windows 93 v0 (Version 0) is a prototype version of Windows 93 that Jankenpopp sent to zombectro to get him to work at Windows 93
>When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.
It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

It also has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message.

However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

On other browsers backgrounds and taskbars dont appear but icons is still appearing.

[DOSBox|http://www.windows93.net/#!dosbox] is an emulator program which emulates an IBM PC compatible computer running DOS. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided with an environment in which they can run correctly, even though modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. 

Windows93's DOSBox comes with programing tools, game creation tools, music softwares and games. It also emulates the Japanese PC-98 computer. Official [JS-DOS|https://js-dos.com] emulator doesn't allow data saving, but Windows93 uses the archive.org DOSBox fork that allows users to save data in their browser's local storage.

*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord

*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
If you're wondering why these are banned: 

*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ is considered the heart of the Windows93 community.

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor [text] - aesthetics text
# /wrap [text] - wrap text in flourish
# /mess [text] - mess text
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /who - List users by [home] 
# /block - Block a user.

# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

(rework)

Basically there was an appstore beta. People found the link to it and we found the beta.

Then we dug in more, and found a mass mailer. Some troll abused it ofc, and then trollbox, bindowzuchan, the store, and wiki93 were shutdown.

A few days later, it all came back (not the store). Some people were banned, and windows93 simply gave _oof._

At 9/11/18, these bans were lifted. However the troll that caused all of this was never found.

The end..............__?__

(get. rid of it)

On February 25th 2020, some dunce made a post in askreddit inquiring about some useless websites to visit.

this caused the wiki and trollbox to be spammed to dust, and Jankenpopp is probably gonna shut down the wiki again.

__thanks, reddit.__

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor [text] - aesthetics text

# /unblock [username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

!Are the people real?

It is basically a copy of 4chan, accessible from [http://windows93.net/b/].

Near the end of June it was taken down after a notice published by Jankenpopp, to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again and hopefully it will stay that way.

Unfortunately the password to edit the wiki was leaked onto the board (most possibly from the same person who leaked it on trollbox) and inundated the wiki with spam and shitposts...

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

The Catex bug was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.

[Windows93 v2|http://v2.windows93.net/] is the second, and currently latest version of [Windows93]. It released on 9th of June 2017 and added many new features, such as [writable local storage|a], [Trollbox], and much more.

It was around the time of Version 2 where the social media aspect of Windows 93 started expanding. A lot of online apps like [Bindowzuchan] and [93 Realms] started getting added.

!Notable changes
!!A: Drive
The most notable change would be the inclusion of local files and the A: Drive which allowed you to store custom files on it. Additionally the A: drive had a folder named boot in it, and any JS file put in this folder would run on startup, which gave birth to custom apps. And any CSS file put in that folder would be applied at startup, which gave birth to custom themes.
!!Trollbox
Trollbox was the first case of social media in Windows 93. It was added in v2 and gave birth to the Windows 93 community.

((https://i.imgur.com/V7ugikv.png|Cat Explorer's Home Page|R))
Cat Explorer is a web browser for Windows 93 introduced in [v1|Windows93 v1]. It functions by embedding an iframe of the URL in the URL bar.

Most websites on the internet don't allow to be iframed which means you won't be able to visit them in Cat Explorer. People have used an extension for ignoring xframe headers to bypass that but it's generally not recommended to use that extension on every site.

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In v1 Cat Explorer had a rainbow icon and its home page was a custom search bar that said "Search some cats" and had a picture of NyanCat's face. This search bar redirected to DuckDuckGo.

Later its homepage was changed to [Skynet].

!!Windows 93 v2
In [v2|Windows93 v2] Cat Explorer remained the same until [Myspace] released and the homepage was changed to Myspace.

page:Windows93 v0 date:20200916052142 content:!Windows 93 Version 0 (Prototype)
((https://i.imgur.com/HDDlOjCl.png|How it looks like|R))
Windows 93 v0 (Version 0) is a prototype version of Windows 93 that Jankenpopp sent to zombectro to get him to work at Windows 93

''When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.|Jankenpopp''

It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

!Chat Window
Version 0 has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message. However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

This seems to be a very early prototype of [Trollbox]

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20200916055110 content:!Introduction
So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

>Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

!Random messages every so often (feat. JSON files!)
_Requested by Ant on Trollbox!_

If you've been on Trollbox for at least 5-10 minutes, you've probably noticed that [harry93] and Gayleb say random things every so often without anyone doing anything. The code behind this interesting feature is actually quite simple. Let me show you!

>__ _DISCLAIMER: The misuse of the following code can get your bot shut down by Jankenpopp and will probably force me to remove this section from the page. So, if you're planning on using this code in your bot, use it responsibly and don't ruin it for everyone else!_ __

!!Getting the list together
Before we get it to say random things, we need to make a list of random things to say! To do this, we can use an external JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. So, in your bot folder, create a new file and call it @@text.json@@. It doesn't have to be called @@text@@, but its extension needs to be @@.json@@. With JSON files, we can store large amounts of numbers, strings, and arrays so it doesn't clog up the main bot file.
{{{
{ // even though json doesn't support commenting, i still would like to mention that curly braces are used to open and close the whole file. you can think of a json file as a lua list almost!
   "funnyNumber": 7,
   "niceGirl": "kailey",
   "distros": [
      "ubuntu",
      "mint",
      "arch",
      "fedora",
      "debian"
   ],
   "player": {
      "x": 53,
      "y": 315
   }      
}
}}}
So for our @@text.json@@, we can create an array called @@quotes@@ or @@random_stuff@@ if you want.
{{{
{
  "quotes": [
    "trans rights are human rights!",
    "every user in this room is real...except me.",
    "kailey is an amazing girl. please send her hugs!",
    "make trollbox friendly again!",
    "jet set radioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
    "be nice, alright?"
  ]
}
}}}
And now, back in our @@index.js@@ file, we can import the JSON file similarly to how you would import a module.
{{{
const text = require('./text.json') // here's our json file!
const moment = require('moment')
const io = require('socket.io-client')
...
}}}
Now that we have our random things, let's make our bot say these things!
!!The actual code behind it
All you have to do is use a @@setInterval();@@ function to make your bot execute code over and over again after a, well, set interval!
{{{
// you can put this line of code just about anywhere in your file. i keep mine at the bottom so it's not in the way.
setInterval(function(){
	socket.emit('message', text.quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*text.quotes.length-1)]) // this line may look familiar. notice how we call the quotes by using "text.quotes".
}, 120000) // this number determines the interval in milliseconds. in this case, its for 2 minutes. you can set this number to whatever you want but i strongly advise to set the interval to over a minute or your bot might become a bit spammy.
}}}
And that's it! Your bot will now say something random every so often!

page:How to Make a Trollbox Bot date:20200916055121 content:_Hey! There's a brand new updated tutorial [here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!_
!Windows
#Install [NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] and Visual Studio Code.
#Make a folder.
#Open Visual Studio Code and go to file -> open folder
#Open your new folder.
#Go to terminal -> new terminal
#Use command prompt
#Insert __npm init__ in the terminal and fill a form, you can leave everthing blank
#Insert __npm install socket.io-client__ in the terminal
#Make a file named index.js and add code (said in code section) and dont forget to ??save!|Ctrl+S??
#To start the bot (after you coded commands), go in the terminal you launched earlier and write __node index__ 
!Code
__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
    path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){
    socket.emit('user joined', 'BOTNAME', 'BOTCOLOR:rgb, hex or CSS predefined colors')
})
}}}
Learn how socket.io-client works.

socket.emit('message','TEXT') emits a message
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname
   //data.color is the color
})
}}}

Example of command (to put inside the socket.on seen previously):
{{{
if (data.msg.toLowerCase().startsWith("£help")) {
      socket.emit('message','Here are the commands: Here write your list of commands')
}
}}}

page:How to make a Trollbox bot v2 date:20200916055137 content:!Introduction
Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

>Note: This tutorial is only for people who run Windows and already have at least a basic understanding on how things work. If you don't know what the Command Prompt is or anything like that, come back to this tutorial later.

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io-client@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (data.msg === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (data.msg.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message", "bar!")
  }

  if (data.msg.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

page:Windows93 v1 date:20200916063738 content:!Windows93 Version 1
((https://i.imgur.com/f0pWCPGl.png|What it looks like|R))
Windows93 v1 is the first functioning version of Windows93. It did not have storage, but it did have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

!History
Windows 93 v1 was the main Windows 93 version until June 9th 2017 when [Version 2|Windows93 v2] released. After that it got moved to a subdomain on [windows93.net|windows93], and can still be accessed trough [http://v1.windows93.net]

With Version 2's new [BIOS feature|BIOS] version 1 was added as an optional boot in the BIOS.

For quite some time [Virtual PC] opened version 1 even on version 2. This was later fixed.

;__What is this?__:This is a wiki, a website on which users collaboratively modify content and structure directly from the web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup language. This website uses something similar to MediaWiki's markup language, called ??wr93|Wiki Renderer 93??.

;__How do I make changes to the wiki?__:In order to make changes, you need to be trusted in the eyes of [Jankenpopp]. More info [here|?].

;__How do I edit the navbar on the left?__:The contents of the navbar are stored [here|Menu].

;__How do I upload images to the wiki to use on pages?__:You can't upload images directly to the wiki, but you can upload images to a website like [imgur|imgur.com] and then link them on pages.

;__Why was the home page uneditable?__:The home page of the wiki used to be uneditable due to the risk of it being destroyed and changed constantly. But now that the wiki is now only editable by trusted users, this isn't an issue anymore.

!Editor FAQ

;__What should I edit?__:For starters there is a category of pages that need fixing in the [fixme category|Category fixme]. You can also make pages for apps that have not been documented yet.

;__Are there any rules?__:Follow common sense and try to keep the style of the pages consistent.

;__Can I remove pages?__:In the literal sense, no. Removing pages would get rid of the page history which is why Jankenpopp doesn't want us to remove pages. However, we have made our own means of removing pages with the [removed category|Category removed].

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and numbers. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

!History
!!2018
Bonzichan launched in early 2018 under the name __Bindowzuchan__. Originally it was hidden from the main Windows 93 site and could only be accessed trough http://windows93.net/b/

!!2019
Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

!!2020
In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. It may be a reference to the ongoing theme of posts related to [BonziWorld] and BonziBuddy happening on the board

!Wiki password leak
The original password to edit the wiki was leaked onto the board, most likely from the same person who leaked it on Trollbox and inundated the wiki with spam and shitposts. After that incident the wiki has remained trusted users only.

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!The Trollbox crown
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering "__*hugs*__" will also disconnect you from Trollbox.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and numbers. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

teaches bad programming + outdated
!Introduction
Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

>Note: This tutorial is only for people who run Windows and already have at least a basic understanding on how things work. If you don't know what the Command Prompt is or anything like that, come back to this tutorial later.

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io-client@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (data.msg === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (data.msg.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message", "bar!")
  }

  if (data.msg.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

!XMAS Mode
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510889725779902464/526704401235312641/unknown.png))

XMAS mode is a Windows 93 event that will trigger every year at the 23th of December.

_NOTE: It didn't trigger in 2017._

In XMAS mode your Windows 93 screen will have snowflakes and the background will change to a random pic from http://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/xmas/bg/

There is also a pop-up message that appears when you boot-up Windows 93

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510889725779902464/526704092052193280/unknown.png)) 

v1 had a different boot-up logo

((http://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/xmas/img/logow.png))

You can find all Windows 93 XMAS Mode backgrounds [here|http://v1.windows93.net/#!dora%20c/sys/xmas/bg/].

((https://i.imgur.com/V7ugikv.png|Cat Explorer's Home Page|R))
__Cat Explorer__ is a web browser for Windows 93 introduced in [v1|Windows93 v1]. It functions by embedding an iframe of the URL in the URL bar.

Most websites on the internet don't allow to be iframed which means you won't be able to visit them in Cat Explorer. People have used an extension for ignoring xframe headers to bypass that but it's generally not recommended to use that extension on every site.

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In v1 Cat Explorer had a rainbow icon and its home page was a custom search bar that said "Search some cats" and had a picture of NyanCat's face. This search bar redirected to DuckDuckGo.

Later its homepage was changed to [Skynet].

!!Windows 93 v2
In [v2|Windows93 v2] Cat Explorer remained the same until [Myspace] released and the homepage was changed to Myspace.

!!Sites that contain Malware 
There are blocked sites on Cat Explorer that would display an error message saying Cat Explorer has blocked this page because it contains malware rather than redirecting you to another site.
These sites are Twitter, Baidu, Linkedin, Blogspot, vk.com, wordpress.com, Pinterest, Tumblr, PayPal, Apple sites, IMBd, AdCash, Neobux, Reddit, 4chan, Stackoverflow, Blogger, Adobe sites, vube.com, ThePirateBay and Netflix

~catexbug~
!The Catex Bug
The Catex bug was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

__DOSBox__ is an emulator program which emulates an IBM PC compatible computer running DOS. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided with an environment in which they can run correctly, even though modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. 

Windows93's DOSBox comes with programing tools, game creation tools, music softwares and games. It also emulates the Japanese PC-98 computer. Official [JS-DOS|https://js-dos.com] emulator doesn't allow data saving, but Windows93 uses the archive.org DOSBox fork that allows users to save data in their browser's local storage.

!History
DOSbox was introduced with [Windows 93 SP3]

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ is considered the heart of the Windows93 community.

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

Probably the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, __Trollbox__ can be considered as the heart of the Windows93 community.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

!The Trollbox crown
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

!Commands
It has basic commands which can be viewed when executing "__/help__".

# /color - Set name color.
# /sin - Sin wave of entered text.
# /sin off - Disable /sin.
# /lorem - Creates a Lorem Ipsum text. With the number of words that you choose.
# /b - Large ASCII of entered text.
# /font number - Select the font for /b
# /reverse - Enables reverse mode which reverses all your entered text.
# /l337 - Enables leet speak mode which enables ultimate hacking skills.
# /normal - Removes all effects like /l337 or /reverse. Booooring..
# /img on/off - Enables/Disables image embedding.
# /yt on/off - Enables/Disables YouTube video embedding.
# /kao - Creates a random kaomoji.
# /emo on/off - Enables/Disables emojis.
# /say - Reads your entered message using TTS.
# /say off/on - Disables the TTS for you.
# /pitch number - Set TTS pitch.
# /rate number - Set TTS rate.
# /voice number - Select a TTS system voice.
# /zalgo -  Convert text into zalgo text.
# /vapor \[text] - aesthetics text
# /wrap \[text] - wrap text in flourish
# /mess \[text] - mess text
# /ascii - Generates ASCII Art of provided image URL.
# /who - List users by [home|Trollbox#Homes]
# /block - Block a user.
# /unblock \[username] - Unblocks the user.
# /unblock - Unblocks all blocked users.
# /scroll - Toggles auto scroll.
# /clear - Clear your chat window.
# /mlg - enable various modes in one command.
# /exe \[command] - Sends a button with the command entered which would run the command in terminal. People mostly use that for sharing Windows 93 apps and viruses.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and numbers. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.


!Banned Trollbox Names
::category fixme
Hard to read, might remove this section entirely 

This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

~Homes~
!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Windows93 v1__ is the first functioning version of [Windows93]. It did not have storage, but it did have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

!History
Windows 93 v1 was the main Windows 93 version until June 9th 2017 when [Version 2|Windows93 v2] released. After that it got moved to a subdomain on windows93.net, and can still be accessed trough [http://v1.windows93.net]

With Version 2's new [BIOS feature|BIOS] version 1 was added as an optional boot in the BIOS.

For quite some time [Virtual PC] opened version 1 even on version 2. This was later fixed.

!!Version 2
Version 2 added a lot of features into Windows 93. Most notably the [A: drive|a] which would allow you to store files, run custom JS and apply custom CSS.

!!Windows 93 v1
In v1 Cat Explorer had a rainbow icon and its home page was a custom search bar that said "Search some cats" and had a picture of NyanCat's face. This search bar redirected to DuckDuckGo.

Later its homepage was changed to [Skynet].

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.

__Windows93's DOSBox__ comes with programing tools, game creation tools, music softwares and games. It also emulates the Japanese PC-98 computer. Official [JS-DOS|https://js-dos.com] emulator doesn't allow data saving, but Windows93 uses the __archive.org DOSBox fork__ that allows users to save data in their browser's local storage.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it. 

!History
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

~Homes~
!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Cat Explorer__ is a web browser for Windows 93 introduced in [v1|Windows93 v1]. It functions by embedding an __iframe__ of the URL in the URL bar.

Most websites on the internet don't allow to be iframed which means you won't be able to visit them in Cat Explorer. People have used an extension for __ignoring xframe headers__ to bypass that but it's generally not recommended to use that extension on every site.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
In v1 Cat Explorer had a rainbow icon and its home page was a custom search bar that said "Search some cats" and had a picture of NyanCat's face. This search bar redirected to DuckDuckGo.

Later its homepage was changed to [Skynet].

~v2~

~Catexbug~
!The Catex Bug
__The Catex bug__ was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects you to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site you were trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.

__DOSBox__ is an emulator program which emulates an IBM PC compatible computer running DOS. Many IBM PC compatible graphics and sound cards are also emulated. This means that original DOS programs (including PC games) are provided with an environment in which they can run correctly, even though modern computers have dropped support for that old environment. 

__Windows93's DOSBox__ comes with programing tools, game creation tools, music softwares and games. It also emulates the Japanese PC-98 computer. Official [JS-DOS|https://js-dos.com] emulator doesn't allow data saving, but Windows93 uses the __archive.org DOSBox fork__ that allows users to save data in their browser's local storage. Windows 93's DOSbox was introduced with [Windows 93 SP3]

- You can press on a button on a window while it is closing. This can cause the Skifree or Marburg [alerts|$alert] to duplicate.
- Making an explorer or catex window to small makes the search feature go out of the window
- The selection produced from an explorer window by dragging its body can go out of the window.
- On "/" in the explorer, you have the option do download /b/ but it produces an error.
- When you resize a window from top top to bottom or left to right too much, it can make it move.
- When you open an app on the terminal, then all apps after that that are opened with a terminal will have the same icon and title as the first one.
- Windows with FX on them have no closing animations.
- When you press enter while making a shortcut, it opens the icon window instead of making the shortcut (more of an oversight)
- Moving a folder into another folder erases all of the document's text that are in that folder.
- Applying some FX to a window (like anogram, vhs, and vh2) makes a white box around it.
- Adding a shortcut, opening the edit menu for it, deleting the shortcut, changing the icon, and trying to apply those changes makes an error and an unclosable window.
- In [Trollbox], when /emo is on, saying things like @@")@@ or @@<)@@ show an emoji when it shouldn't.
- In Trollbox, if you have /l337 or /reverse on, some other built in commands don't work.
- Kof93 has an effect that can make some processers produce a faint beep even when sound is turned off.'
- Pressing start in defrag multiple times will duplicate the sound.

~Solitude~
!!Solitude Bugs
- In [Solitude|Solitude], you can drag a card on the top stack even if there are cards underneath it.

- In Solitude, you can click on cards at the bottom of the down-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag cards at the bottom of the top-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card on the top stack off and drag a card underneath it. You can do anything you want with the card underneath.
- In Solitude, you can still drag cards after the win screen appears.
- In Solitude, you can drag a card from the top of a stack and let go. Then drag the bottom card while it is going back to its original position. This should drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, do the previous bug but do it on a single card that is at the bottom of the stack. When you drag this card while it is sliding, the card above it should cling to your mouse and you can drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, the green circle that appears in the top left doesnt change your cursor despite being clickable.
- In Solitude, you can double click back facing cards and they sometimes move to the top stack. Any cards beneath it, including blue cards, will appear at the top stack.

__Windows 93 v0 (Version 0)__ is a prototype version of Windows 93 that [Jankenpopp] sent to [Zombectro] to get him to work at Windows 93

''When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.|Jankenpopp''

It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

~Chat~
!Chat Window
Version 0 has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message. However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

This seems to be a very early prototype of [Trollbox]

__Windows93 v1__ is the first functioning version of Windows93. It did not have storage, but it did have a read-only drive on /c/.

The explorer window was a very primitive folder viewer, which only displayed the contents of a directory and nothing else. Clicking on a folder simply opened a new window with the contents of that folder. It lacks a location bar, and buttons.

The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.

[93 Realms|http://windows93.net/#!93realms] is a MUD (multi-player text based role playing game). Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The new text adventure was wrote by [Morusque|http://nurykabe.com/]. The current source is now maintained by Pokazef and downloadable here: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

The name _93 Realms_ was voted by the windows93 community.

"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
In [Windows93 v1] Trollbox's icon was first known as __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). Clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

~v2~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat").

The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The application was quickly exploited by some redditor (see [Reddit Hug]) which used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file on the C:/ drive. The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

~v2~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

[Windows93 v2|http://v2.windows93.net/] (Codenammed XN, which would stand for xn--xp8haa, the punycode for 👌👌👌) is the second, and currently latest version of [Windows93]. It released on 9th of June 2017 and added many new features, such as [writable local storage|a], [Trollbox], and much more.

It was around the time of Version 2 where the social media aspect of Windows 93 started expanding. A lot of online apps like [Bindowzuchan] and [93 Realms] started getting added.

!Notable changes
!!A: Drive
The most notable change would be the inclusion of local files and the A: Drive which allowed you to store custom files on it. Additionally the A: drive had a folder named boot in it, and any JS file put in this folder would run on startup, which gave birth to custom apps. And any CSS file put in that folder would be applied at startup, which gave birth to custom themes.
!!Trollbox
Trollbox was the first case of social media in Windows 93. It was added in v2 and gave birth to the [Windows 93 community|Windows93 Discord].

!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The application was quickly exploited by some redditor (see [Reddit Hug]) which used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file on the C:/ drive. The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

~v2~
!!Windows 93 v2 Aplha
Another php chat was developed during the alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point on, using php to build a chat was abandoned.

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's help command, like "[!help]" in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

___You need headers for a trollbox bot at the moment. If you can't figure that out, you aren't good enough of a programmer to make one.___

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

You can find a list of all the current bots [here|List of active Trollbox bots].

!!!Here is a list of former bots:

}}}

!!Useful information
__If a text doesn't show, it's not necessarily a script error. Verify these points before!__
- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.
- A bot can not have a banned name. [Click here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?Banned%20trollbox%20names|Banned Trollbox Names] for the list of banned names.

The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The application was quickly exploited by some redditor (see [Reddit Hug]) who used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file on the C:/ drive. The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

~v2~
!!Windows 93 v2 Aplha
Another php chat was developed during the alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using php to build the windows93 chat was abandoned.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: nature and peinture. The application was quickly exploited by some redditor (see [Reddit Hug]) who used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file on the C:/ drive. The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93

* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism.

!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1 – Clavardage
The original release of windows93 (2014) came with a php chat based on the use of text files: __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: nature and peinture. The application was quickly exploited by some redditor (see [Reddit Hug]) who used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file on the C:/ drive. The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

!!Windows 93 v1 – Framapad
The first version of windows93 came with a Framapad icon on the desktop (https://framapad.org/p/windows93). Framapad is a free, collaborative online text editing service managed by Framasoft. At the first Reddit hug, users were so numerous on the windows93 pad that they crashed the entire framapad.org service, preventing thousands of people from accessing their professional documents. A trace of this event can be found here: [https://twitter.com/gerancet/status/527017133902147584]
The editing of the framapad document of windows93 was definitely corrupted but the document included an anonymous and functional chat that the first users of windows93 began to use to communicate with each other. This is how the proto-community of trollbox/windows93 was formed [Framapad chat screenshot|https://64.media.tumblr.com/df9bc2fcb20fefaf27d84bdd769c7df3/tumblr_nenprdDcNl1roureso1_500.png].

A reference to this can be found in a xkcd comic strip: [https://xkcd.com/1305/]

~v2~
!!Windows 93 v2 Aplha
Another php chat was developed during the alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using php to build the windows93 chat was abandoned.

!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
!!!Clavardage
The original release of Windows93 (2014) came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

 __Framapad__ is a free, collaborative online text editing service managed by __Framasoft__. The first version of Windows93 came with a __Framapad__ icon on the Desktop that went to https://framapad.org/p/windows93. The editing of the Framapad document of Windows93 was corrupted but the document included an anonymous and functional chat that the first users of Windows93 began to use to communicate with each other. This is how the proto-community of trollbox/Windows93 was formed.

The first __Reddit hug users__ were so numerous on the Windows93 pad that they crashed the entire framapad.org service, preventing thousands of people from accessing their professional documents. A trace of this event can be found [on this Tweet|https://twitter.com/gerancet/status/527017133902147584]

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

~History~

There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However you could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~

Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
::category fixme
Hard to read, might remove this section entirely 

This is a list of banned trollbox names. Anything in __bold__ you have to put that as your username, otherwise it can be anywhere in your name. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*__undefined__ 
*__null__
*__blank text__ (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*discord, sonic, fortnite, and roblox: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*exe: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Framapad__ is a free, collaborative online text editing service managed by __Framasoft__. The first version of [Windows93] came with a __Framapad__ icon on the Desktop that went to https://framapad.org/p/windows93. The editing of the Framapad document of Windows93 was corrupted but the document included an anonymous and functional chat that the first users of Windows93 began to use to communicate with each other. This is how the proto-community of [Trollbox]/Windows93 was formed.

This was referenced in [XKCD comic strip 1305|https://xkcd.com/1305/].

~RedditHug~
!The Reddit Hug incident
The first [Reddit hug users|Reddit Hug] were so numerous on the Windows93 pad that they crashed the entire framapad.org service, preventing thousands of people from accessing their professional documents. A trace of this event can be found [on this Tweet|https://twitter.com/gerancet/status/527017133902147584]

When a website hits the front page of Reddit.com, its server take so much traffic that it can get overloaded and crash, causing the site to be inaccessible until the amount of traffic dies down a bit. It's basically like an unintentional DDOS attack.

!Windows 93 Hugs
Windows93 had 3 majors hugs since its launch. 
The first hug took place a few hours after the launch of the site and is at the origin of its incredible popularity on the Internet:

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However you could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action))

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows you to set a username, and color for it.

The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However you could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect you.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect you from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when you type it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as your name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces your name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__ and __undefined__: banned due to programming issues
*__blank text__: why would you put blank text as your username
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: if this was allowed, you wont be able to block them (as some words are banned)
*__exe__: unknown but it used to hide the message that said you entered, left, or changed your username

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

((https://i.imgur.com/vxgZVHc.png|Windows 93 v2 beta|R))
The __Windows93 v2 beta__ is the open beta version of [Windows93 v2]. It was publicly available on June 3rd 2015.

There were a few Beta testers for it that were listed under [credits.html|/c/credits.html].

~Cut Content~
!Cut content
There were several cut features from the v2 beta that didn't make it into the release of v2.
~Notes~
!!Notes app
One of the most notable examples is the notes app. It worked similarly like modern Windows notes. The notes app can still be ran on modern Windows 93 by getting the original JS from [web.archive.org]
~Pins~
!!Pinned windows
In the v2 beta you were able to pin windows to the top, which would mean that any window that would normally go over it would always be under it.
~Home~
!!Home folder
The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.
~Desktop~
!!Desktop icons
There are some desktop icons from the v2 beta that were removed in the release. Most of these icons are icons that just triggered [FX], like Pizzaacid which triggered the acid effect and an upside town computer icon which triggered the upside down effect.

~UsingV2Beta~
!Using V2 beta
It is still possible to boot into V2 beta by either making your own clone by getting files from web.archive.org or by using one of the existing v2 beta clones like [http://domenic.darkok.xyz/index_.html]

((https://i.imgur.com/GjP4x6Q.png|Version 3|R))

__Windows 93 v3__ is the next planned version of Windows 93. According to the [developers|Category developers] it can take up to 4 years to release. 

It is currently not under development.

~Features~
!Confirmed planned features

The only confirmed feature we have for version 3 is a successor to [Sys42], a new framework that would look more like Windows 98. While version 3 itself isn't under development, the framework is.

page:Windows93 v0 date:20200917221359 content:!Windows 93 Version 0 (Prototype)
((https://i.imgur.com/HDDlOjCl.png|How it looks like|R))
__Windows 93 v0 (Version 0)__ is a prototype version of Windows 93 that [Jankenpopp] sent to [Zombectro] to get him to work at Windows 93

''When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.|Jankenpopp''

It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

~Chat~
!Chat Window
Version 0 has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When you type a message into the message box, your browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including your IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message. However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

This seems to be a very early prototype of [Trollbox]

__93 Realms__ is a multi-player text based role playing game introduced with [SP3]. Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world online.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for __SimpleMUD__ was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. You can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

~Pins~
!!Pinned windows
In the v2 beta you were able to pin windows to the top, which would mean that any window that would normally go over it would always be under it.
~Home~
!!Home folder
The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config|a#config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.
~Desktop~
!!Desktop icons
There are some desktop icons from the v2 beta that were removed in the release. Most of these icons are icons that just triggered [FX], like Pizzaacid which triggered the acid effect and an upside town computer icon which triggered the upside down effect.

~UsingV2Beta~
!Using V2 beta
It is still possible to boot into V2 beta by either making your own clone by getting files from web.archive.org or by using one of the existing v2 beta clones like [http://domenic.darkok.xyz/index_.html]

__Wiki93__ is a community wiki for [Windows93] that runs on ChuWiki

~History~
!History
Wiki93 was originally featured as just a hidden link under http://www.windows93.net/wiki/. At one point the [community|Windows93 Discord] found the link to the wiki. Initially the password for it was a tiny riddle rather than it being locked behind [Jankenpopp]. 

The riddle was
>How do you type voodoo twice with just six characters? Tip: "You know, I looked at my face in the mirror this morning, and I like being old. My face has more content and when I train in the gym now, I am not training to be strong or handsome - just better than I was yesterday. These days the race is just against myself." –Jean-Claude Van Damme

The answer to this riddle was X88B88. This was changed after the [Wiki raid|Wiki93#Raid].

~Raid~
!Wiki Raid
Sometime in 2018 the password to the wiki was shared on [Trollbox] and [Bonzichan|Bindowzuchan] which resulted in a raid of the wiki, pages were replaced with spams and shitposts. Afterwards the wiki became trusted users only.

Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. It may be a reference to the ongoing theme of posts related to [BonziWorld] and BonziBuddy happening on the board

The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. You can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

__Bonzichan__ (Also known as __Bindowzuchan__ or __/b/__) is an image board accessible from [http://windows93.net/b/] or the /b/ drive on [Windows93].

~History~
!History
~2018~
!!2018
Bonzichan launched in early 2018 under the name Bindowzuchan. Originally it was hidden from the main Windows 93 site and could only be accessed trough http://windows93.net/b/

~2019~
!!2019
Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

~2020~
!!2020
In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. This is because of a post to /b/ made by a impersonator of Jankenpopp, that claimed that if the post got 100 bumps, he would change the imageboard's name to Bonzichan. After the real Jankenpopp saw that the post had got 100 bumps, he decided to change it to Bonzichan.

__93 Realms__ is a multi-player text based role playing game introduced with [SP3]. Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world online.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for __SimpleMUD__ was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. You can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

The name 93 Realms was voted by the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

93 Realms is MUD. MUDs are played by entering text commands for specific actions (Ex: Going south would be done with the command @@south@@ and attacking would be done with the command @@attack@@).

Since exploring is mostly done trough commands new players can get lost, which is why many players make their own maps to orientate around the game's world.

You can __shorten__ most of these commands instead of typing all of them. A few useful examples would be:
-@@attack [enemy]@@ can just be shortened to @@attack@@ to automatically attack the first thing in a set room.
-@@attack@@ can also just be shortened to @@a@@
-Similarly to @@attack@@ @@get [item]@@ can just be shortened to @@get@@ or @@g@@. However, this does not work on money.
-For @@attack@@, @@get@@, @@buy@@, @@sell@@ and other commands that require you to type an item name or enemy name you can write the first couple of letters/words of an enemy/item instead. (Ex: If you want to use a minor healing potion you can do @@use minor@@ instead of @@use minor healing potion@@)
-Directional commands can just be shortened to @@s@@ for south, @@w@@ for west, @@n@@ for north and @@e@@ for east.

The original codebase for __SimpleMUD__ was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. You can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

The name 93 Realms was voted by the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

~Gameplay~
!Gameplay
93 Realms is MUD. MUDs are played by entering text commands for specific actions (Ex: Going south would be done with the command @@south@@ and attacking would be done with the command @@attack@@).

Since exploring is mostly done trough commands new players can get lost, which is why many players make their own maps to orientate around the game's world.

~Commands~
!!Commands
This is a list of all commands 93 Realms uses
-__/__ - Repeats your last command exactly
-__experience__ - Shows your experience statistics
-__inventory__ - Shows a list of your items
-__stats__ - Shows all of your statistics
-__quests__ - Shows your achieved quests
-__use \[item]__ - Use or equip an item in your inventory
-__remove \[weapon/armor]__  - Removes your weapon or armor
-__get/drop \[item]__ - Picks up or drops an item on the ground
-__north/east/south/west__ - Moves in a direction
-__look__ - Shows you the contents of a room
-__attack \[enemy]__ - Attack an enemy or a player
-__run \[pattern]__ - Run to some location (Ex: @@run 3w1s@@)
-__train__ - Train to the next level (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__editstats__ - Edit your statistics (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__list__ - Lists items you can buy or sell in a store
-__buy/sell \[item]__ - Buy or Sell an item in a store
-__who__ - Shows a list of everyone online
-__whisper \[who] \[msg]__ - Sends message to one person (Can be used even if both people aren't in the same room)
-__time__ - Shows the current system time
-__password \[pass]__ - Change your password
-__quit__ - Allows you to leave the realm

~ShorteningCommands~
!!!Shortening
You can __shorten__ most of these commands instead of typing their full counterparts. A few useful examples would be:
-@@attack \[enemy]@@ can just be shortened to @@attack@@ to automatically attack the first thing in a set room.
-@@attack@@ can also just be shortened to @@a@@
-Similarly to @@attack@@ @@get \[item]@@ can just be shortened to @@get@@ or @@g@@. However, this does not work on money.
-For @@attack@@, @@get@@, @@buy@@, @@sell@@ and other commands that require you to type an item name or enemy name you can write the first couple of letters/words of an enemy/item instead. (Ex: If you want to use a minor healing potion you can do @@use minor@@ instead of @@use minor healing potion@@)
-Directional commands can just be shortened to @@s@@ for south, @@w@@ for west, @@n@@ for north and @@e@@ for east.

~Leveling~
!!Leveling up
When you reach 100% or more experience point you are able to __level up__ by __training__. Training can only be done in training rooms. There a few training rooms around the 93 Realms world but the closest one to Town Square would be the one south of Town Square. After you train you get two stat points you can apply to any of your stats by doing @@editstats@@.

page:Trollbox date:20201002084442 content:!Trollbox
((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action|R))
__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

~Features~

~Crown~
!!The Trollbox crown
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: Unknown

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

((https://i.imgur.com/yyqTl4Y.png|93 Realms|R))

__93 Realms__ is a multi-player text based role playing game introduced with [SP3]. Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world online.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for __SimpleMUD__ was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. Users can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

The name 93 Realms was voted by the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

~Gameplay~
!Gameplay
93 Realms is MUD. MUDs are played by entering text commands for specific actions (Ex: Going south would be done with the command @@south@@ and attacking would be done with the command @@attack@@).

Since exploring is mostly done trough commands new players can get lost, which is why many players make their own maps to orientate around the game's world.

~Commands~
!!Commands
This is a list of all commands 93 Realms uses
-__/__ - Repeats the player's last command exactly
-__experience__ - Shows the player's experience statistics
-__inventory__ - Shows a list of the player's items
-__stats__ - Shows all of the player's statistics
-__quests__ - Shows the player's achieved quests
-__use \[item]__ - Use or equip an item in the player's inventory
-__remove \[weapon/armor]__  - Removes a weapon or armor
-__get/drop \[item]__ - Picks up or drops an item on the ground
-__north/east/south/west__ - Moves in a direction
-__look__ - Shows the player's the contents of the room they're currently in
-__attack \[enemy]__ - Attack an enemy or a player
-__run \[pattern]__ - Run to some location (Ex: @@run 3w1s@@)
-__train__ - Train to the next level (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__editstats__ - Edit the player's statistics (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__list__ - Lists items the player can buy or sell in a store
-__buy/sell \[item]__ - Buy or Sell an item in a store
-__who__ - Shows a list of everyone online
-__whisper \[who] \[msg]__ - Sends message to one person (Can be used even if both people aren't in the same room)
-__time__ - Shows the current system time
-__password \[pass]__ - Change the player's password
-__quit__ - Allows the player to leave the realm

~ShorteningCommands~
!!!Shortening
Players can __shorten__ most of these commands instead of typing their full counterparts. A few useful examples would be:
-@@attack \[enemy]@@ can just be shortened to @@attack@@ to automatically attack the first thing in a set room.
-@@attack@@ can also just be shortened to @@a@@
-Similarly to @@attack@@ @@get \[item]@@ can just be shortened to @@get@@ or @@g@@. However, this does not work on money.
-For @@attack@@, @@get@@, @@buy@@, @@sell@@ and other commands that requires players to type an item name or enemy name can be written with  the first couple of letters/words of an enemy/item instead. (Ex: If a player want to use a minor healing potion they can do @@use minor@@ instead of @@use minor healing potion@@)
-Directional commands can just be shortened to @@s@@ for south, @@w@@ for west, @@n@@ for north and @@e@@ for east.

~Leveling~
!!Leveling up
When a player reaches 100% or more experience point they are able to __level up__ by __training__. Training can only be done in training rooms. There a few training rooms around the 93 Realms world but the closest one to Town Square would be the one south of Town Square. After players train they get two stat points that can be applied to any of the player's stats by doing @@editstats@@.

~Community~

The 93 Realms community made its own Wiki and Discord server (At the time of writing, the wiki is quite outdated). They also frequently update their own community map.

__Cat Explorer__ is a web browser for Windows 93 introduced in [v1|Windows93 v1]. It functions by embedding an __iframe__ of the URL in the URL bar.

Most websites on the internet don't allow to be iframed which means users won't be able to visit them in Cat Explorer. People have used an extension for __ignoring xframe headers__ to bypass that but it's generally not recommended to use that extension on every site.

!!Windows 93 v1
In v1 Cat Explorer had a rainbow icon and its home page was a custom search bar that said "Search some cats" and had a picture of NyanCat's face. This search bar redirected to DuckDuckGo.

Later its homepage was changed to [Skynet].

~Catexbug~
!The Catex Bug
__The Catex bug__ was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects users to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site the user was trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.

__Windows 93 v0 (Version 0)__ is a prototype version of Windows 93 that [Jankenpopp] sent to [Zombectro] to get him to work at Windows 93

''When we started to think about making some web project together, I made that v0 prototype very quickly  and I send it to zombectro in order to convince him to build that windows93 project with me.|Jankenpopp''

It can be still accessed at [v0.windows93.net|http://v0.windows93.net/].

~Chat~
!Chat Window
Version 0 has a commented-out chat window, which apparently uses the PHP @@include()@@ to get chat messages.

When users typed a message into the message box, their browser will send a post request to envoie.php (which doesn't exist) including the user's IP (which was going to be used as a nickname), and the message. However, for reasons (possibly involving having to reload to get new messages and XSS) this chatbox was commented out, and envoie.php and data.txt were taken off the server.

This seems to be a very early prototype of [Trollbox]

[Windows93 v2|http://v2.windows93.net/] (Codenammed XN, which would stand for xn--xp8haa, the punycode for 👌👌👌) is the second, and currently latest version of [Windows93]. It released on 9th of June 2017 and added many new features, such as [writable local storage|a], [Trollbox], and much more.

It was around the time of Version 2 where the social media aspect of Windows 93 started expanding. A lot of online apps like [Bindowzuchan] and [93 Realms] started getting added.

!Notable changes
!!A: Drive
The most notable change would be the inclusion of local files and the A: Drive which allowed users to store custom files on it. Additionally the A: drive had a folder named boot in it, and any JS file put in this folder would run on startup, which gave birth to custom apps. And any CSS file put in that folder would be applied at startup, which gave birth to custom themes.
!!Trollbox
Trollbox was the first case of social media in Windows 93. It was added in v2 and gave birth to the [Windows 93 community|Windows93 Discord].

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~EasterEggs~

Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks.

*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if you had "exe" in your username (there used to have a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed" above it), and if you did, it would not show the ".... is now known as ...." message in the chat. Some users then started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes your nickname to "💩" instead.

((https://i.imgur.com/yyqTl4Y.png|93 Realms|R))

__93 Realms__ is a multi-player text based role playing game introduced with [SP3]. Players create their own characters to explore a fantasy world online.

93 Realms is based on SimpleMUD. The original codebase for __SimpleMUD__ was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book, and ported to NodeJS by Long Nguyen, then heavily modified by [Jankenpopp] in order to add a game editor, some new features (quest system, custom scripts, pvp, etc..) and fix security and stability problems. The text adventure itself was written by [Morusque]. The current source is now maintained by __Pokazef__ and downloadable on GitHub: [https://github.com/pokazef/93realms].

93 Realms runs trough __Telnet__ which means it can be accessed trough any command line tool that can run Telnet. Users can access it trough @@telnet windows93.net 8082@@

The name 93 Realms was voted by the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

~Gameplay~
!Gameplay
93 Realms is MUD. MUDs are played by entering text commands for specific actions (Ex: Going south would be done with the command @@south@@ and attacking would be done with the command @@attack@@).

Since exploring is mostly done trough commands new players can get lost, which is why many players make their own maps to orientate around the game's world.

~Commands~
!!Commands
This is a list of all commands 93 Realms uses
-__/__ - Repeats the player's last command exactly
-__experience__ - Shows the player's experience statistics
-__inventory__ - Shows a list of the player's items
-__stats__ - Shows all of the player's statistics
-__quests__ - Shows the player's achieved quests
-__use \[item]__ - Use or equip an item in the player's inventory
-__remove \[weapon/armor]__  - Removes a weapon or armor
-__get/drop \[item]__ - Picks up or drops an item on the ground
-__north/east/south/west__ - Moves in a direction
-__look__ - Shows the player's the contents of the room they're currently in
-__attack \[enemy]__ - Attack an enemy or a player
-__run \[pattern]__ - Run to some location (Ex: @@run 3w1s@@)
-__train__ - Train to the next level (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__editstats__ - Edit the player's statistics (Can be only used in training rooms)
-__list__ - Lists items the player can buy or sell in a store
-__buy/sell \[item]__ - Buy or Sell an item in a store
-__who__ - Shows a list of everyone online
-__whisper \[who] \[msg]__ - Sends message to one person (Can be used even if both people aren't in the same room)
-__time__ - Shows the current system time
-__password \[pass]__ - Change the player's password
-__quit__ - Allows the player to leave the realm

~ShorteningCommands~
!!!Shortening
Players can __shorten__ most of these commands instead of typing their full counterparts. A few useful examples would be:
-@@attack \[enemy]@@ can just be shortened to @@attack@@ to automatically attack the first thing in a set room.
-@@attack@@ can also just be shortened to @@a@@
-Similarly to @@attack@@ @@get \[item]@@ can just be shortened to @@get@@ or @@g@@. However, this does not work on money.
-For @@attack@@, @@get@@, @@buy@@, @@sell@@ and other commands that requires players to type an item name or enemy name can be written with  the first couple of letters/words of an enemy/item instead. (Ex: If a player want to use a minor healing potion they can do @@use minor@@ instead of @@use minor healing potion@@)
-Directional commands can just be shortened to @@s@@ for south, @@w@@ for west, @@n@@ for north and @@e@@ for east.

~Stats~
!!Stat points
93 Realms has a couple of different __stat points__ that alter the player's gameplay experience. Some of them can be changed by [leveling up|93 Realms#Leveling] and others depend on armor and weapons.

~LevelStats~
!!!Leveling up stat points
These stat points can be changed when the player levels up and gains stat points. Some items are also able modify these stat points but they are uncommon.
-__Strength__ - Modifies how much damage you deal to enemies.
-__Health__ - Modifies your max HP
-__Agility__ - Modifies your accuracy and dodging

~OtherStats~
!!!Other stat points
Most of these stat points automatically increase when the player levels up and are also modified by most equipable items.
-__HP__ - The player's health points
-__Accuracy__ - Modifies the player's chance of hitting an enemy. Modified by weapons
-__Dodging__ - Modifies the player's chance of getting hit by an enemy. Modified by armor
-__Strike Damage__ - Does not automatically increase when you level up. Extra damage modifier
-__Damage absorb__ - Does not automatically increase when you level up. Extra defense.

~Leveling~
!!Leveling up
When a player reaches 100% or more experience point they are able to __level up__ by __training__. Training can only be done in training rooms. There a few training rooms around the 93 Realms world but the closest one to Town Square would be the one south of Town Square. After players train they get two stat points that can be applied to any of the player's stats by doing @@editstats@@.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The original release of Windows93 came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of v2, it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

page:How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome date:20201004122341 content:::category fixme
god please end me
!Introduction
So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

>Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

!Random messages every so often (feat. JSON files!)
_Requested by Ant on Trollbox!_

If you've been on Trollbox for at least 5-10 minutes, you've probably noticed that [harry93] and Gayleb say random things every so often without anyone doing anything. The code behind this interesting feature is actually quite simple. Let me show you!

>__ _DISCLAIMER: The misuse of the following code can get your bot shut down by Jankenpopp and will probably force me to remove this section from the page. So, if you're planning on using this code in your bot, use it responsibly and don't ruin it for everyone else!_ __

!!Getting the list together
Before we get it to say random things, we need to make a list of random things to say! To do this, we can use an external JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. So, in your bot folder, create a new file and call it @@text.json@@. It doesn't have to be called @@text@@, but its extension needs to be @@.json@@. With JSON files, we can store large amounts of numbers, strings, and arrays so it doesn't clog up the main bot file.
{{{
{ // even though json doesn't support commenting, i still would like to mention that curly braces are used to open and close the whole file. you can think of a json file as a lua list almost!
   "funnyNumber": 7,
   "niceGirl": "kailey",
   "distros": [
      "ubuntu",
      "mint",
      "arch",
      "fedora",
      "debian"
   ],
   "player": {
      "x": 53,
      "y": 315
   }      
}
}}}
So for our @@text.json@@, we can create an array called @@quotes@@ or @@random_stuff@@ if you want.
{{{
{
  "quotes": [
    "trans rights are human rights!",
    "every user in this room is real...except me.",
    "kailey is an amazing girl. please send her hugs!",
    "make trollbox friendly again!",
    "jet set radioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
    "be nice, alright?"
  ]
}
}}}
And now, back in our @@index.js@@ file, we can import the JSON file similarly to how you would import a module.
{{{
const text = require('./text.json') // here's our json file!
const moment = require('moment')
const io = require('socket.io-client')
...
}}}
Now that we have our random things, let's make our bot say these things!
!!The actual code behind it
All you have to do is use a @@setInterval();@@ function to make your bot execute code over and over again after a, well, set interval!
{{{
// you can put this line of code just about anywhere in your file. i keep mine at the bottom so it's not in the way.
setInterval(function(){
	socket.emit('message', text.quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*text.quotes.length-1)]) // this line may look familiar. notice how we call the quotes by using "text.quotes".
}, 120000) // this number determines the interval in milliseconds. in this case, its for 2 minutes. you can set this number to whatever you want but i strongly advise to set the interval to over a minute or your bot might become a bit spammy.
}}}
And that's it! Your bot will now say something random every so often!

page:How to Make a Trollbox Bot date:20201004122353 content:::category fixme
teaches bad programming + outdated
_Hey! There's a brand new updated tutorial [here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!_
!Windows
#Install [NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] and Visual Studio Code.
#Make a folder.
#Open Visual Studio Code and go to file -> open folder
#Open your new folder.
#Go to terminal -> new terminal
#Use command prompt
#Insert __npm init__ in the terminal and fill a form, you can leave everthing blank
#Insert __npm install socket.io-client__ in the terminal
#Make a file named index.js and add code (said in code section) and dont forget to ??save!|Ctrl+S??
#To start the bot (after you coded commands), go in the terminal you launched earlier and write __node index__ 
!Code
__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
    path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){
    socket.emit('user joined', 'BOTNAME', 'BOTCOLOR:rgb, hex or CSS predefined colors')
})
}}}
Learn how socket.io-client works.

socket.emit('message','TEXT') emits a message
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname
   //data.color is the color
})
}}}

Example of command (to put inside the socket.on seen previously):
{{{
if (data.msg.toLowerCase().startsWith("£help")) {
      socket.emit('message','Here are the commands: Here write your list of commands')
}
}}}

__Windows 93__ is a website styled to look and work as an OS, often called a [Web OS|Category WebOS]. It's developed by [Jankenpopp] and [Zombectro].
It features several [apps|Category apps] with memes mainly from the early 2000s. They are used to represent how the internet was during that time.

Windows 93 started when Jankenpopp proposed to Zombectro about working on a Web OS together.

~History~

~v0~
!!Version 0
The [version 0|Windows93 v0] was the prototype Janken sent Zombectro. It included basic windows and start menu.
~v1~
!!Version 1
[Version 0|Windows93 v1] was the first true release of Windows 93, it added more functionality to windows and start menu and added a lot of meme apps. However, it wouldn't be until [V2|Windows93 v2] that local files would be added.
~v2~
!!Version 2
Version 2 added a lot of features into Windows 93. Most notably the [A: drive|a] which would allow you to store files, run custom JS and apply custom CSS. It was around this time the social aspect of Windows 93 started with things like [Trollbox] and [Bindowzuchan]. Also because of the social aspect a community around Windows 93 started forming, sharing themes and custom apps among each other.

!Windows 93 v1 Beta
The first version of Windows 93, found at [v1.windows93.net], has had a massive amount of features removed in favour of some being added to [Windows93 v2], released in 2017.

Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, dragging desktop icons around, several versions of [Bananamp], a tetris game, and an account system.

Several screenshots can be found in /c/files/images/promo and show early versions during different stages in development. The information in this page is obtained from screenshots, leaked files, and commented out code.

!Scrapped Apps
!!Audio
Audio was a scrapped music player, eventually being replaced by [Bananamp], seen in an early screenshot. It seems to be a basic audio file player, at the time containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/764965503235391498/chrome_l0KXQYKPAq.png))
!!Clavardage
Windows 93 originally had a chat long before [Trollbox]. This was actually there for a couple of days after [Windows 93 v1] first launched.
From the screenshot that exists of it, it appears to be a generic chat widget with no theme on it. There were two rooms, Nature and Peinture.

After release, it was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the Reddit Hugs who used it to write the ILOVEYOU.TXT file.
The developers found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:
__directX.dll missing dude, cthulhu is using the chat coming back soon__

Before all of this, there was another chat in development which is mentioned later in this page.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/764960988583297074/unknown.png))
!!Bananamp
According to several lines of code and leaked files, Bananamp with advanced visualizer features that have not been added to this day, was originally planned to be added 3 years before it was officially released. 

The only thing left from the Visualization feature is a single one, used in __G80.M3U__. A screenshot of another one, with a drop down menu at the bottom for selecting other visualizers can be found in the keynote images.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/764946340672176158/unknown.png|Bananamp Screenshot))

!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows 93 v1] and are fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the File Explorer. Roms for them still exist.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/764963054144061440/unknown.png))

!!Tunnel
Tunnel was a program containing a tunnel animation. The files for it still exist. It was removed a while after launch.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168099073720320/unknown.png))
!!Blox
Blox was a tetris game that was broken on launch, and removed shortly afterwards. We only have the icon of it archived.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/764964954926743592/unknown.png))

!Design Changes
!!Font
Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168507444789248/unknown.png))

!!Taskbar
The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168838341296148/unknown.png))

!!Startmenu
The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon. 

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168956465348658/unknown.png))

!!Footer
Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169295230894080/unknown.png))

!!Terminal
The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

((https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/699354946050457730/765169513712582666/unknown.png))

!Scrapped Features

!!Local Storage
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as ''LocalStorage (A:)'' or ''Local (A:)'' along with a drive named ''Data (D:)'' the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening dora and typing /a/ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169697078902794/unknown.png))

!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2]

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169951404589057/unknown.png))

!!Custom Apps
An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

((https://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/ico32/magic.png))

!WAMP
There was a scrapped user account system for multiplayer apps which would be powered by a wamp p2p server. This would involve users signing up for an account and then being able to use their registered nickname in games. This was planned for v2 again but then scrapped in favor of using socket.io instead.

!!Accounts
There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765170385255268362/unknown.png))
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped), then later rewritten for [Windows 93 v2 Beta] with the exe command (and scrapped again).

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765170780563570708/unknown.png))
!!Qursor
This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

!!Tunnel
Tunnel was a program containing a tunnel animation. The files for it still exist. It was removed a while after launch.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168099073720320/unknown.png))
!!Blox
Blox was a tetris game that was broken on launch, and removed shortly afterwards. We only have the icon of it archived.

!Design Changes
!!Font
Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168507444789248/unknown.png))

!!Taskbar
The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168838341296148/unknown.png))

!!Startmenu
The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon. 

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765168956465348658/unknown.png))

!!Footer
Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169295230894080/unknown.png))

!!Terminal
The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

((https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/699354946050457730/765169513712582666/unknown.png))

!Scrapped Features

!!Local Storage
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as ''LocalStorage (A:)'' or ''Local (A:)'' along with a drive named ''Data (D:)'' the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening dora and typing /a/ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169697078902794/unknown.png))

!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2]

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765169951404589057/unknown.png))

!!Custom Apps
An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

((https://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/ico32/magic.png))

!WAMP
There was a scrapped user account system for multiplayer apps which would be powered by a wamp p2p server. This would involve users signing up for an account and then being able to use their registered nickname in games. This was planned for v2 again but then scrapped in favor of using socket.io instead.

!!Accounts
There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765170385255268362/unknown.png))
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped), then later rewritten for [Windows93 v2 beta] with the exe command (and scrapped again).

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765170780563570708/unknown.png))
!!Qursor
This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

~2018~

Bonzichan launched in early 2018 under the name Bindowzuchan. Originally it was hidden from the main Windows 93 site and could only be accessed trough http://windows93.net/b/

~2019~
!!2019
Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

~2020~
!!2020
In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. This is because of a post to /b/ made by a impersonator of [Jankenpopp], that claimed that if the post got 100 bumps, he would change the imageboard's name to Bonzichan. After the real Jankenpopp saw that the post had got 100 bumps, he decided to change it to Bonzichan.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism.

The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to the developers, another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
In the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] an online chat was available trough the [Terminal]

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

Unlike the modern Trollbox, the v2 beta chat used a database.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

~Catexbug~
!The Catex Bug
__The Catex bug__ was a bug / vulnerability in the [noframe.php|http://www.windows93.net/c/programs/catExplorer/noframe.php] file on windows93. It was discovered on 06/05/2020 and fixed soon after.

The noframe.php file was used in previous versions of catex to inform the user if the page they are trying to access does not allow framing (being embedded in another website).

What catex would do is check if the page allows framing, and if it doesn't, redirects users to noframe.php, with an `url` parameter, to say what site the user was trying to access.

However, this page did not filter HTML elements, which could allow users to do many things, such as:

- Escaping the iframe on Catex, allowing users to run code on windows93 from a visited website.
- Complete access over the windows93.net domain from external pages.
- Modifying the windows93 boot sequence using redirects.
- Using custom trollbox clients outside of windows93.

[Windows93 v2|http://v2.windows93.net/] (Codenammed XN, which would stand for xn--xp8haa, the punycode for 👌👌👌) is the second, and currently latest version of [Windows93]. It released on 9th of June 2017 and added many new features, such as [writable local storage|a], [Trollbox], and much more.

It was around the time of Version 2 where the social media aspect of Windows 93 started expanding. A lot of online apps like [Bindowzuchan] and [93 Realms] started getting added.

!Notable changes
!!A: Drive
The most notable change would be the inclusion of [local files and the A: Drive|a] which allowed users to store custom files on it. Additionally the A: drive had a folder named boot in it, and any JS file put in this folder would run on startup, which gave birth to custom apps. And any CSS file put in that folder would be applied at startup, which gave birth to custom themes.
!!Trollbox
[Trollbox] was the first case of social media in Windows 93. It was added in v2 and gave birth to the [Windows 93 community|Windows93 Discord].

The __Windows93 v2 beta__ is the open beta version of [Windows93 v2]. It was publicly available on June 3rd 2015.

There were a few Beta testers for it that were listed under [credits.html|/c/credits.html].

~Cut Content~
!Cut content
There were several cut features from the v2 beta that didn't make it into the release of [v2|Windows93 v2].
~Notes~
!!Notes app
One of the most notable examples is the notes app. It worked similarly like modern Windows notes. The notes app can still be ran on modern Windows 93 by getting the original JS from [web.archive.org]
~Pins~
!!Pinned windows
In the v2 beta users were able to pin windows to the top, which would mean that any window that would normally go over it would always be under it.
~Home~
!!Home folder
The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config|a#config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.
~Desktop~
!!Desktop icons
There are some desktop icons from the v2 beta that were removed in the release. Most of these icons are icons that just triggered [FX], like Pizzaacid which triggered the acid effect and an upside town computer icon which triggered the upside down effect.

~UsingV2Beta~
!Using V2 beta
It is still possible to boot into V2 beta by either making a clone by getting files from web.archive.org or by using one of the existing v2 beta clones like [http://domenic.darkok.xyz/index_.html]

The server was made on 10th of June 2017 by __litevx__ as a small [Trollbox] server. Later it was added to this [wiki|wiki93] and advertised heavily in Trollbox gaining a lot of new members including some [developers|Category developers].

In 2020 after some drama the ownership of the server was transferred to [Jankenpopp]

((https://i.imgur.com/0u2xiZn.png|Beta Screenshot|R))
The first version of Windows 93, found at [v1.windows93.net], has had a massive amount of features removed from it during its beta process in favour of some being added to [Windows93 v2], released in 2017. Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, Dragging desktop icons around, several versions of [Bananamp], a Tetris game, and an account system.

~CutContent~
!Cut content
Several screenshots of the v1 beta can be found in @@/c/files/images/promo@@ and show early versions during different stages in development. Some commented out code from the beta has also been left in [v1|Windows93 v1]

!!Accounts
There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games and chat.

~Chat~
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would use WAMP and run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped earlier in [v1|Windows93 v1]'s lifespan), then later rewritten for [Windows93 v2 beta] with the exe command (and then scrapped again).

~Audio~
!!Audio
Audio was a scrapped music player, eventually being replaced by [Bananamp], seen in an early screenshot. It seems to be a basic audio file player, at the time containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__

~Bananamp~
!!Bananamp
According to several lines of code and leaked files, Bananamp with advanced visualizer features that have not been added to this day, was originally planned to be added 3 years before it was officially released. The only thing left from the Visualization feature is a single one, used in __G80.M3U__. A screenshot of another one, with a drop down menu at the bottom for selecting other visualizers can be found in the keynote images.

~Emulators~
!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows93 v1] and are fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the File Explorer. ROMs for them still exist on v1.

~Design~
!!Design Changes
((https://i.imgur.com/Yd6AEEn.png|Design Changes|R))

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

~Drives~
!!Cut drives
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as @@LocalStorage (A:)@@ or @@Local (A:)@@ along with a drive named @@Data (D:)@@ the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening explorer and typing __/a/__ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

~Icons~
!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2].

~Qursor~
!!Qursor

This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

~CustomApps~
!!Custom Apps

An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1Beta~
!!Windows 93 v1 Beta
The [Windows93 v1 beta]'s [Terminal] had a chat feature. It had no commands and it was scrapped before the release of [v1|Windows93 v1]

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [v1 Beta chat|Trollbox#v1Beta] was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action|R))
__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

page:How to make a Trollbox bot v2 date:20201018091118 content:::category fixme
teaches bad programming + outdated
!Introduction
Hello there and welcome to the new tutorial! Today, I'm going to help you create your very own Trollbox bot from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simple bot up and running. So, let's get started!

>Note: This tutorial is only for people who run Windows and already have at least a basic understanding on how things work. If you don't know what the Command Prompt is or anything like that, come back to this tutorial later.

!Prerequisites (what you will need)
In order to create a bot, you will need the following things:
!!An understanding of JavaScript
The bot that you'll be making in this tutorial will be coded in JavaScript, a programming language that you shouldn't mix up with Java.
!!A text editor
There are sooooo many text editors that you can use. I personally use [Atom|https://atom.io/] which is open source and very easy to use.
!!NodeJS
[NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] is what we are going to use to run the bot, so go ahead and install it.
!!An idea of your bot
What's your bot going to be called? What will it do? Does it abide to the bot guidelines? You need to have at least a little idea of what your bot is going to be like initially before getting started.

Got everything? Great! Let's do this!
!Setting up your environment
Note: I'm going to be using Atom. You don't have to as well but just keep that in mind if I do something that isn't available in the text editor you're using.
#Start by creating a new folder for your bot.
#Create a new file in the folder and call it @@index.js@@.
#Open a Command Prompt window in the same folder and type in @@npm init@@. This will initialize our bot. You can just leave everything blank by pressing Enter if you want.
#Type in @@npm install socket.io-client@@ to install Socket.io. Socket.io is what allows our bot to connect, chat and listen for commands.

Now that our workspace is ready, let's get to coding!
!Yay! The coding bit!
!!Getting your bot to connect
#Open up @@index.js@@ in your chosen text editor if you haven't already.
#Type in (or paste in if you must) this code.
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client') // requiring socket.io
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', { // this is the socket we're connecting to!
    path: '/socket.io', // these few lines are just for other important things
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){ // and once we're connected...
    socket.emit('user joined', 'examplebot', "#00ff00") // ...our bot can join!
})
}}}

Once you do that, go to the Command Prompt, type in @@node index@@ and check Trollbox to see if your bot joined. If it did, congratulations! You have a working bot shell! Now all we need is functionality.
!!Making your bot do stuff
In order for our bot to be able to say and do stuff, we're going to need to give it the ability to listen to messages. To do this, we need the bot to check for when a message gets sent.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){ // when any message appears in trollbox...
  // run the code in here!
})
}}}
Now, when we receive a message, we get 3 variables:
- @@data.nick@@ - the user's nickname
- @@data.msg@@ - the message that the user sent
- @@data.color@@ - the user's color.
These three variables can be used in various ways from telling someone what they're colour is to responding to certain messages from certain people. But for now, we're just going to use @@data.msg@@, probably the most important one out of the three.

To make our bot respond to a message/command, we need to check if the message is, contains, or starts with something.
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){

  if (data.msg === "ping") {
    socket.emit("message", "pong!")
  }

  if (data.msg.includes("foo")) {
    socket.emit("message", "bar!")
  }

  if (data.msg.startsWith("baz")) {
    socket.emit("message", "qux!")
  }

})
}}}
Type the code above into your file, run the bot, and type "ping", "foo" or "baz" into Trollbox to see if it works!

!You did it!
Now your bot can join Trollbox, listen to commands and respond! Try giving your bot a prefix and some more simple commands to get a feel of how it all works. But if you're ready for bigger and better things for your bot, check out my other tutorial called [How to Make Your Trollbox Bot Awesome]!

teaches bad programming + outdated
_Hey! There's a brand new updated tutorial [here|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!_
!Windows
#Install [NodeJS|https://nodejs.org/] and Visual Studio Code.
#Make a folder.
#Open Visual Studio Code and go to file -> open folder
#Open your new folder.
#Go to terminal -> new terminal
#Use command prompt
#Insert __npm init__ in the terminal and fill a form, you can leave everthing blank
#Insert __npm install socket.io-client__ in the terminal
#Make a file named index.js and add code (said in code section) and dont forget to ??save!|Ctrl+S??
#To start the bot (after you coded commands), go in the terminal you launched earlier and write __node index__ 
!Code
__In the following examples, the code written in lowercase is what you shouldn't change and the code in CAPITAL LETTERS is what you have to change based on the examples.__
Your code will start with this
{{{
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
    path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
        polling: {
            extraHeaders: {
                'Origin': 'http://www.windows93.net',
                'Referer': 'http://www.windows93.net/trollbox/index.php'
            }
        }
    }
})
socket.on('_connected', function(data){
    socket.emit('user joined', 'BOTNAME', 'BOTCOLOR:rgb, hex or CSS predefined colors')
})
}}}
Learn how socket.io-client works.

socket.emit('message','TEXT') emits a message
{{{
socket.on('message',function(data){
   //data.msg is the message
   //data.nick is the nickname
   //data.color is the color
})
}}}

Example of command (to put inside the socket.on seen previously):
{{{
if (data.msg.toLowerCase().startsWith("£help")) {
      socket.emit('message','Here are the commands: Here write your list of commands')
}
}}}

!Introduction
So you've set up your Trollbox bot but don't know what to do next? Not to worry! This page is packed with snippets of code that you can either directly add to your bot and/or tweak to suit your own bot's needs.

>Note: This tutorial is for people who already have a bot up and running. If you would like to learn how to make a bot, [read this first|http://www.windows93.net/wiki/93.php?How%20to%20make%20a%20Trollbox%20bot%20v2]!

!Things to point out
!!1. This page is still a work-in-progress
I am constantly refining and adding new examples to this page when I can so watch this page!
!!2. You're not alone in this
If you think that you're not going to receive any help while you're learning about all this then you're sadly mistaken. Each snippet contains comments that explain whats going on in each line. Additionally, if you do have any other questions and/or queries, contact me. I'm on the official Windows 93 Discord so don't be shy! There are no stupid questions when it comes to me.
!!3. What extensions are
Extensions are little bonus activities that you can do to take things a small step further so your bot can stand out from the others. While they are optional, it is good practice to do them so then not only does your bot and code stand out, but you also get a feel and better understanding of the code, therefore, making your a better programmer in the process!
!!4. What challenges are
Challenges, much like extensions, are bonuses that take the example one step further and also test your knowledge. Again, these are optional and are only there if you want to, well, challenge yourself.

!Better message handling
A good thing to do is to add this at the beginning of the message event:
{{{
var message = data.msg.toLowerCase(); // the message is converted to all lowercase so our commands can be case-unsensitive!
var args = message.split(' ').slice(1); // this line will be very useful for some example commands later on. the ".slice(1)" at the end takes away the command and prefix so we're only left with the actual arguments.
}}}
So, from now on each if statement will look something like this:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("command")) {
    // our code will be in here!
}
}}}
Now with that out of the way, let's get to some commands!

!Sum of two numbers
For this example, we're going to be using two arguments taken from the user, thanks to that line of code above.
{{{
  if (message.startsWith("h:add2")) {                                 // the command is called "add2", funny enough.
      if (args[1] === undefined) {                                    // if there isnt a 2nd number to add...
        socket.emit('message', "not enough args! need two numbers.")  // send an error message.
        return;                                                       // and then end the command here.
      }

      n1 = Number(args[0]);                                           // since the arguments are strings, we need to convert them to numbers
      n2 = Number(args[1]);

      sum = (n1 + n2).String();                                     // but then, we can convert it back to a string again.

      socket.emit('message', sum)                                     // send the sum!
  }
}}}
!!Extension: More than two numbers
Try to tweak the command a bit to make it able to add as many numbers as the user gives it.
!!Challenge: Calculator
Here's a real difficult one! Try to make the bot able to evaluate any maths equation! It's hard, but not impossible. Give it a go!

!Colour wheel
In this command, we're going to be using RNG and predetermined arrays!
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:colourwheel")) {                                         // you already know what this line's about by now...hopefully...
    var colours = ["blue", "red", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "green", "cyan"]     // here's our colours, all snug in a little array!
    var landedOn = colours[Math.round(Math.random() * (colours.length - 0) + 0)]     // a random selection from the colour wheel is stored in "landedOn"

    socket.emit('message', "the colour wheel has landed on " + landedOn)             // send the selection!
}
}}}
!!Extension: Not just colours
You can change the array name and contents and make a completely differently themed command. This is only just to help you out, so make it your own and let your imagination run wild!

!Using other npm modules
Did you know that you can use other modules in your code? I mean, it is a node application after all, right? For this example, we're going to utilize a neat little module called "moment" to tell the time.
!!Installing moment
First, we need to install moment before we can import it. So in order to do that, stop your bot by hitting Ctrl+C in the terminal and then type in "npm install moment":
{{{
^C
C:\Users\You\WhereverYour\BotFolderIs> npm install moment
}}}
Give it up to a minute to install and then you're ready for the next step!
!!Requiring moment
With moment installed, we can now import it! To do so, type this line of code in somewhere at the top of your file:
{{{
const moment = require('moment') //put this in!
const io = require('socket.io-client')
const socket = io('http://www.windows93.net:8081', {
  path: '/socket.io',
    transportOptions: {
      polling: {
          extraHeaders: {
// etc etc etc....
}}}
!!Using moment
We've installed it, imported it and now it's time to put it into action! Here's a command that outputs the time in UTC:
{{{
if (message.startsWith("h:utctime")) { // mhm
      socket.emit('message','it is currently ' + moment.utc().format('h:mma') + " UTC") // if you're not sure what's going on in this line, go check out the moment.js docs.
}
}}}
!!Challenge 1: Timezones
While this time-telling command is cool and all, it only displays the time for a singular timezone. See if you can make your bot display the time in a certain timezone using arguments and moment's sister module "moment timezone"!
!!Challenge 2: Yet another module
The use of modules in your bot doesn't stop with moment. See if you can use other npm modules in your bot. Who knows, you might make something revolutionary!

!Random messages every so often (feat. JSON files!)
_Requested by Ant on Trollbox!_

If you've been on Trollbox for at least 5-10 minutes, you've probably noticed that [harry93] and Gayleb say random things every so often without anyone doing anything. The code behind this interesting feature is actually quite simple. Let me show you!

>__ _DISCLAIMER: The misuse of the following code can get your bot shut down by Jankenpopp and will probably force me to remove this section from the page. So, if you're planning on using this code in your bot, use it responsibly and don't ruin it for everyone else!_ __

!!Getting the list together
Before we get it to say random things, we need to make a list of random things to say! To do this, we can use an external JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file. So, in your bot folder, create a new file and call it @@text.json@@. It doesn't have to be called @@text@@, but its extension needs to be @@.json@@. With JSON files, we can store large amounts of numbers, strings, and arrays so it doesn't clog up the main bot file.
{{{
{ // even though json doesn't support commenting, i still would like to mention that curly braces are used to open and close the whole file. you can think of a json file as a lua list almost!
   "funnyNumber": 7,
   "niceGirl": "kailey",
   "distros": [
      "ubuntu",
      "mint",
      "arch",
      "fedora",
      "debian"
   ],
   "player": {
      "x": 53,
      "y": 315
   }      
}
}}}
So for our @@text.json@@, we can create an array called @@quotes@@ or @@random_stuff@@ if you want.
{{{
{
  "quotes": [
    "trans rights are human rights!",
    "every user in this room is real...except me.",
    "kailey is an amazing girl. please send her hugs!",
    "make trollbox friendly again!",
    "jet set radioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo",
    "be nice, alright?"
  ]
}
}}}
And now, back in our @@index.js@@ file, we can import the JSON file similarly to how you would import a module.
{{{
const text = require('./text.json') // here's our json file!
const moment = require('moment')
const io = require('socket.io-client')
...
}}}
Now that we have our random things, let's make our bot say these things!
!!The actual code behind it
All you have to do is use a @@setInterval();@@ function to make your bot execute code over and over again after a, well, set interval!
{{{
// you can put this line of code just about anywhere in your file. i keep mine at the bottom so it's not in the way.
setInterval(function(){
	socket.emit('message', text.quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*text.quotes.length-1)]) // this line may look familiar. notice how we call the quotes by using "text.quotes".
}, 120000) // this number determines the interval in milliseconds. in this case, its for 2 minutes. you can set this number to whatever you want but i strongly advise to set the interval to over a minute or your bot might become a bit spammy.
}}}
And that's it! Your bot will now say something random every so often!

 localforage.getItem('filename.txt').then(function(okthen){return okthen}) // get contents of a file
 localforage.removeItem("filename.txt") // delete a file
 localforage.clear() // delete all files from IndexedDB
 localforage.keys().then(function(files){/* do something with files*/}) // returns an array of all files stored in IndexedDB 

!!IndexedDB (Async)
 $db.set("file.txt", "hello world") // create a file
 $db.del("file.txt") // delete a file
 $db.clear() // delete all files from IndexedDB
 $db.getRaw("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the RAW file content
 $db.get("file.txt", callback) // callback() returns the file content, if JSON, returns the parsed result
 $db.keys(callback) // callback() returns null and an array of files stored in IndexedDB

!!localStorage (Sync)
 $store.set('desktop/meme.txt', 'hello world'); // create meme.txt in desktop
 $store.get("desktop/meme.txt") // returns 
 $store.clear() // delete all files from localStorage
 $store.getRaw('desktop/meme.txt') // read file meme.txt in desktop
 $store.del("desktop/meme.txt") // delete a file
 $store.keys() // returns all files saved into localStorage

 $explorer.refresh() // refresh explorer
 $archive('/folder/name')  // put the contents of the folder into a zipped archive that you can download, does not always work on folders in /c/

The $file global is an API for interacting with Windows93's file system. It has several utility functions which can aid in almost all of an app's interactions with the file system.


!! $file.getUrl 
The @@getUrl@@ function returns a created Object URL for the file's [Blob|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob] form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.getUrl(filePath, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the Object URL

!!! Example 
    $file.getUrl('/a/trash/trash.jpg', $log)
Retrieve the file @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@, and print it's Object URL in the terminal.

!!! Usefulness 
This is functionally the same as invoking @@$file.open@@ with @@'URL'@@ as the form, but it's shorter and slightly faster; in the end it's up to preference.


!! $file.open 
The @@open@@ function returns the contents of a file in a specified form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.open(filePath, form, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@form@@ - A string representing the form the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however @@'String'@@ will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!!! Examples 
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@String@@, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@Blob@@'s object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@ as an @@ArrayBuffer@@, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!!! Usefulness 
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as @@ArrayBuffers@@ and URLs in a single function.


!! $file.iterateFolder 
The @@iterateFolder@@ function runs a callback for every child file of a directory, passing the file's path.

!!! Usage 
    $file.iterateFolder(directoryPath, callback)
Where
* @@directoryPath@@ - A string containing the directory's path
* @@callback@@ - The function to be invoked with the file paths

__$alert__ is a global function in Windows93 accessible from @@window@@. It displays a message box at the center of the screen by default.

!! Usage
    $alert(options, callback)

Where the properties of @@options@@ are:
* btnOk - The label for the "OK" button.
* btnCancel - The label for the "Cancel" button.
* cb - Optional callback.
* img - The icon of the alert.
* msg - The content of the alert.
* sound - The sound to play. Can be @@alert@@, @@boot@@, or @@error@@.
* title - The title of the alert.

@@callback@@ is a function which should have 1 argument, that being
* isOk - @@true@@ if the user pressed OK, @@false@@ if not.

You may also pass a string instead of an object to @@options@@.

* @@form@@ - A string representing the form the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however @@'String'@@ will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!!! Examples 
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@String@@, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@Blob@@'s object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@ as an @@ArrayBuffer@@, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!!! Usefulness 
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as @@ArrayBuffers@@ and URLs in a single function.


!! $file.iterateFolder 
The @@iterateFolder@@ function runs a callback for every child file of a directory, passing the file's path.

!!! Usage 
    $file.iterateFolder(directoryPath, callback)
Where
* @@directoryPath@@ - A string containing the directory's path
* @@callback@@ - The function to be invoked with the file paths

! $file 
The $file global is an API for interacting with Windows93's file system. It has several utility functions which can aid in almost all of an app's interactions with the file system.


!! $file.getUrl 
The @@getUrl@@ function returns a created Object URL for the file's [Blob|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob] form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.getUrl(filePath, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the Object URL

!!! Example 
    $file.getUrl('/a/trash/trash.jpg', $log)
Retrieve the file @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@, and print it's Object URL in the terminal.

!!! Usefulness 
This is functionally the same as invoking @@$file.open@@ with @@'URL'@@ as the form, but it's shorter and slightly faster; in the end it's up to preference.


!! $file.open 
The @@open@@ function returns the contents of a file in a specified form.

!!! Usage 
    $file.open(filePath, form, callback)
Where
* @@filePath@@ - A string containing the file's path
* @@form@@ - A string representing the form the file's contents is to be returned in. Conversion is handled by the $io API, meaning that you're limited to what conversion options it allows from the original form of the file, however @@'String'@@ will always be an option.
* @@callback@@ - A function which will be invoked with the file contents, aswell as the form the file was originally stored in.

!!! Examples 
    $file.open('/a/README.txt', 'String', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@String@@, and print them to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/system32.dll', 'URL', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/README.txt@@ as a @@Blob@@'s object URL, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

    $file.open('/a/trash/trash.jpg', 'ArrayBuffer', $log)
Retrieve the contents of @@/a/trash/trash.jpg@@ as an @@ArrayBuffer@@, and print it to the terminal with it's original form.

!!! Usefulness 
This is one of the most flexible and powerful methods of retrieving files. Especially it's ability to retrieve files as @@ArrayBuffers@@ and URLs in a single function.

page:Windows93 v1 beta date:20201018135643 content:!Windows 93 v1 (Beta)
((https://i.imgur.com/0u2xiZn.png|Beta Screenshot|R))
The first version of Windows 93, found at [v1.windows93.net], has had a massive amount of features removed from it during its beta process in favour of some being added to [Windows93 v2], released in 2017. Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, Dragging desktop icons around, several versions of [Bananamp], a Tetris game, and an account system.

~CutContent~
!Cut content
Several screenshots of the v1 beta can be found in @@/c/files/images/promo@@ and show early versions during different stages in development. Some commented out code from the beta has also been left in [v1|Windows93 v1]

!!Accounts
There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games and chat.

~Chat~
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would use WAMP and run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped earlier in [v1|Windows93 v1]'s lifespan), then later rewritten for [Windows93 v2 beta] with the exe command (and then scrapped again).

~Audio~
!!Audio
Audio was a scrapped music player, eventually being replaced by [Bananamp], seen in an early screenshot. It seems to be a basic audio file player, at the time containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__

~Bananamp~
!!Bananamp
According to several lines of code and leaked files, [Bananamp] with advanced visualizer features that have not been added to this day, was originally planned to be added 3 years before it was officially released. The only thing left from the Visualization feature is a single one, used in __G80.M3U__. A screenshot of another one, with a drop down menu at the bottom for selecting other visualizers can be found in the keynote images.

~Emulators~
!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows93 v1] and are fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the File Explorer. ROMs for them still exist on v1.

~Design~
!!Design Changes
((https://i.imgur.com/Yd6AEEn.png|Design Changes|R))

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

~Drives~
!!Cut drives
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as @@LocalStorage (A:)@@ or @@Local (A:)@@ along with a drive named @@Data (D:)@@ the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening explorer and typing __/a/__ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

~Icons~
!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2].

~Qursor~
!!Qursor
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765171536985587712/unknown.png))

This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

~CustomApps~
!!Custom Apps
((https://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/ico32/magic.png))

An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

((https://i.imgur.com/0u2xiZn.png|Beta Screenshot|R))
The first version of Windows 93, found at [v1.windows93.net], has had a massive amount of features removed from it during its beta process in favour of some being added to [Windows93 v2], released in 2017. Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, Dragging desktop icons around, several versions of [Bananamp], a Tetris game, and an account system.

~CutContent~
!Cut content
Several screenshots of the v1 beta can be found in @@/c/files/images/promo@@ and show early versions during different stages in development. Some commented out code from the beta has also been left in [v1|Windows93 v1]

~Accounts~
!!Accounts
There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games and chat.

~Chat~
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would use WAMP and run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped earlier in [v1|Windows93 v1]'s lifespan), then later rewritten for [Windows93 v2 beta] with the exe command (and then scrapped again).

~Audio~
!!Audio
Audio was a scrapped music player, eventually being replaced by [Bananamp], seen in an early screenshot. It seems to be a basic audio file player, at the time containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__

~Bananamp~
!!Bananamp
According to several lines of code and leaked files, [Bananamp] with advanced visualizer features that have not been added to this day, was originally planned to be added 3 years before it was officially released. The only thing left from the Visualization feature is a single one, used in __G80.M3U__. A screenshot of another one, with a drop down menu at the bottom for selecting other visualizers can be found in the keynote images.

~Emulators~
!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows93 v1] and are fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the File Explorer. ROMs for them still exist on v1.

~Design~
!!Design Changes
((https://i.imgur.com/Yd6AEEn.png|Design Changes|R))

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

~Drives~
!!Cut drives
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as @@LocalStorage (A:)@@ or @@Local (A:)@@ along with a drive named @@Data (D:)@@ the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening explorer and typing __/a/__ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

~Icons~
!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2].

~Qursor~
!!Qursor
((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699354946050457730/765171536985587712/unknown.png))

This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

~CustomApps~
!!Custom Apps
((https://v1.windows93.net/c/sys/ico32/magic.png))

An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

!The Backdoor ARG
((https://i.imgur.com/8OpOJQd.png|Backdoor|R))
The __Backdoor ARG__ was an ARG Windows93 that would lead to [Windows93 v2] when solved.

~Solution~
!Solution
The ARG originally started with www.windows93.net being replaced with a page informing users that the FBI has seized the Windows93 domain. The page can still be found on [http://www.windows93.net/fbi/fbi.php]. The page source contained a comment with ASCII art of The X Files and binary code that would translate to @@backdoor.html@@. Going to [https://www.windows93.net/backdoor.html] would bring you to a page with a password field. Entering the ??correct password (Hover to reveal)|incorrect?? would bring you to [v2|Windows93 v2].

~BackdoorAnswers~
!!Other Backdoor answers
The Backdoor had some unique easter eggs on its own when you entered specific passwords in the password field.

*__penis__ - Entering penis would display a text box saying that your password is too long.

*??The first password (Hover to reveal)|FUTUR1993?? - Entering the first password would display a text box that would say "Well tried but that one would be too easy!"

~History~
!History
Originally the backdoor linked to [v2|Windows93 v2], but after v2's full release it linked to [Bonzichan|Bindowzuchan]. After Bonzichan became public the Backdoor now links to nothing. ip:130.204.89.210

__Bonzichan__ (Also known as __Bindowzuchan__ or __/b/__) is an image board accessible from [http://windows93.net/b/] or the /b/ drive on [Windows93].

~History~
!History

!!2018
Bonzichan launched in early 2018 under the name Bindowzuchan. Originally it was hidden from the main Windows 93 site and was found trough the [Backdoor].

!!2019
Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

~2020~
!!2020
In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. This is because of a post to /b/ made by a impersonator of [Jankenpopp], that claimed that if the post got 100 bumps, he would change the imageboard's name to Bonzichan. After the real Jankenpopp saw that the post had got 100 bumps, he decided to change it to Bonzichan.

The __Windows93 v2 beta__ is the open beta version of [Windows93 v2]. It was publicly available on June 3rd 2015.

There were a few Beta testers for it that were listed under [credits.html|/c/credits.html].

~Cut Content~
!Cut content
There were several cut features from the v2 beta that didn't make it into the release of [v2|Windows93 v2].
~Notes~
!!Notes app
One of the most notable examples is the notes app. It worked similarly like modern Windows notes. The notes app can still be ran on modern Windows 93 by getting the original JS from [web.archive.org]
~Pins~
!!Pinned windows
In the v2 beta users were able to pin windows. This would make them open every time Windows93 booted.
~Home~
!!Home folder
The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config|a#config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.
~Desktop~
!!Desktop icons
There are some desktop icons from the v2 beta that were removed in the release. Most of these icons are icons that just triggered [FX], like Pizzaacid which triggered the acid effect and an upside town computer icon which triggered the upside down effect.

~UsingV2Beta~
!Using V2 beta
It is still possible to boot into V2 beta by either making a clone by getting files from web.archive.org or by using one of the existing v2 beta clones like [http://domenic.darkok.xyz/index_.html]

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

The Trollbox crown is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1Beta~
!!Windows 93 v1 Beta
The [Windows93 v1 beta]'s [Terminal] had a chat feature that would use WAMP. It had no commands and it was scrapped before the release of [v1|Windows93 v1]

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [v1 Beta chat|Trollbox#v1Beta] was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] by using a database and with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped before [v2|Windows93 v2]'s release.

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
*Any message containing "among us" will run the Crazy error.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*among us
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, __roblox__ and __among us__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

__The Trollbox crown__ is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1Beta~
!!Windows 93 v1 Beta
The [Windows93 v1 beta]'s [Terminal] had a chat feature that would use WAMP. It had no commands and it was scrapped before the release of [v1|Windows93 v1]

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [v1 Beta chat|Trollbox#v1Beta] was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] by using a database and with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped before [v2|Windows93 v2]'s release.

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
*Any message containing "among us" will run the Crazy error.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*among us
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, __roblox__ and __among us__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

Rooms creation has an anti-spam filter that has a three level warning system. Whenever a user creates too many rooms they will be disconnected from Trollbox with a warning showing how much they have left before being banned. These warnings are:

*__Stop spamming. [1/3]__ - For level 1
*__Bitch please. [2/3]__ - For level 2
*__Want a free ban? [3/3]__ - For level 3
*__You just lost your epic privileges.__ - For when the user is banned

*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__, __roblox__ and __among us__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown.

!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

*__Bitch please. \[2/3]__ - For level 2

The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.

[Windows93 v2|http://v2.windows93.net/] (Also known as __SP2__ or __XN__, which would stand for xn--xp8haa, the punycode for 👌👌👌) is the second, and currently latest version of [Windows93]. It released on 9th of June 2017 and added many new features, such as [writable local storage|a], [Trollbox], and much more.

It was around the time of Version 2 where the social media aspect of Windows 93 started expanding. A lot of online apps like [Bindowzuchan] and [93 Realms] started getting added.

!Notable changes
!!A: Drive
The most notable change would be the inclusion of [local files and the A: Drive|a] which allowed users to store custom files on it. Additionally the A: drive had a folder named boot in it, and any JS file put in this folder would run on startup, which gave birth to custom apps. And any CSS file put in that folder would be applied at startup, which gave birth to custom themes.
!!Trollbox
[Trollbox] was the first case of social media in Windows 93. It was added in v2 and gave birth to the [Windows 93 community|Windows93 Discord].

((https://i.imgur.com/vxgZVHc.png|Windows 93 v2 beta|R))
The __Windows93 v2 beta__ is the open beta version of [Windows93 v2]. It was publicly available on June 3rd 2015.

There were a few Beta testers for it that were listed under [credits.html|/c/credits.html].

~Cut Content~
!Cut content
There were several cut features from the v2 beta that didn't make it into the release of [v2|Windows93 v2].
~Notes~
!!Notes app
One of the most notable examples is the notes app that was originally in [v1|Windows93 v1] but was cut from the final release of [v2|Windows93 v2].
~Pins~
!!Pinned windows
In the v2 beta users were able to pin windows. This would make them open every time Windows93 booted.
~Home~
!!Home folder
The v2 beta used a home directory for things like Desktop and [.config|a#config] similarly to Linux. It also seemed to have somewhat planned functionality for multiple users that has been left in [Sys42] to this day.
~Desktop~
!!Desktop icons
There are some desktop icons from the v2 beta that were removed in the release. Most of these icons are icons that just triggered [FX], like Pizzaacid which triggered the acid effect and an upside town computer icon which triggered the upside down effect.

~UsingV2Beta~
!Using V2 beta
It is still possible to boot into V2 beta by either making a clone by getting files from web.archive.org or by using one of the existing v2 beta clones like [http://domenic.darkok.xyz/index_.html]

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


__The Trollbox crown__ is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Rooms~
!!Rooms
__Rooms__ act like different chatrooms in Trollbox. Users in one room cannot see messages from other rooms. These rooms can be freely created by users of Trollbox with the main room being called __atrium__. User created rooms are deleted when no users are left in them.

Rooms creation has an anti-spam filter that has a three level warning system. Whenever a user creates too many rooms they will be disconnected from Trollbox with a warning showing how much they have left before being banned. These warnings are:

*__Stop spaming. \[1/3]__ - For level 1
*__Bitch please. \[2/3]__ - For level 2
*__Want a free ban? \[3/3]__ - For level 3
*__You just lost your epic privileges.__ - For when the user is banned

After the final disconnect the user won't be able to connect to the Trollbox again.

~v1Beta~
!!Windows 93 v1 Beta
The [Windows93 v1 beta]'s [Terminal] had a chat feature that would use WAMP. It had no commands and it was scrapped before the release of [v1|Windows93 v1]

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called __Clavardage__ (french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.
The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] who used it to write the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] found it fun and left the file in place, but disabled the chat.
Since, clicking on the icon would result in an error message displaying saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,
>cthulhu is using the chat
>coming back soon

The error message remained until the release of modern Trollbox.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [v1 Beta chat|Trollbox#v1Beta] was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] by using a database and with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped before [v2|Windows93 v2]'s release.

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
*Any message containing "among us" will run the Crazy error.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*among us
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__ and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots. They are, in fact, not.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


__The Trollbox crown__ is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Rooms~
!!Rooms
__Rooms__ act like different chatrooms in Trollbox. Users in one room cannot see messages from other rooms. These rooms can be freely created by users of Trollbox with the main room being called __atrium__. User created rooms are deleted when no users are left in them.

Rooms creation has an anti-spam filter that has a three level warning system. Whenever a user creates too many rooms they will be disconnected from Trollbox with a warning showing how much they have left before being banned. These warnings are:

*__Stop spaming. \[1/3]__ - For level 1
*__Bitch please. \[2/3]__ - For level 2
*__Want a free ban? \[3/3]__ - For level 3
*__You just lost your epic privileges.__ - For when the user is banned

After the final disconnect the user won't be able to connect to the Trollbox again. 

~Commands~
!!Commands

There used to be buttons in the start menu for registering for an account and signing in. Attempting to sign in would open a login screen where you log into an account and get to use your claimed nickname in multiplayer games and chat.

~Chat~
!!Chat
There used to be a simple chat application that would use WAMP and run in the terminal. You could send messages and the only command was exit. This was scrapped in favor of Clavardage (which was also scrapped earlier in [v1|Windows93 v1]'s lifespan), then later rewritten for [Windows93 v2 beta] with the exe command (and then scrapped again).

~Audio~
!!Audio
Audio was a scrapped music player, eventually being replaced by [Bananamp], seen in an early screenshot. It seems to be a basic audio file player, at the time containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__

~Bananamp~
!!Bananamp
According to several lines of code and leaked files, [Bananamp] with advanced visualizer features that have not been added to this day, was originally planned to be added 3 years before it was officially released. The only thing left from the Visualization feature is a single one, used in __G80.M3U__. A screenshot of another one, with a drop down menu at the bottom for selecting other visualizers can be found in the keynote images.

~Emulators~
!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows93 v1] and are fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the File Explorer. ROMs for them still exist on v1.

~Design~
!!Design Changes
((https://i.imgur.com/Yd6AEEn.png|Design Changes|R))

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

~Drives~
!!Cut drives
The A: drive, letting you save and edit files, was originally planned to be added to v1. There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as @@LocalStorage (A:)@@ or @@Local (A:)@@ along with a drive named @@Data (D:)@@ the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening explorer and typing __/a/__ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

~Icons~
!!Draggable Desktop Icons
According to a screenshot where you can see several desktop icons moved around, you were able to drag desktop icons around, which wasn't possible until [Windows93 v2].

This was a game where you would go into an arena of cursors and try to click each other to get points. The developers played it for a while then forgot about it.

An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms.

There are several leaked files mentioning it showing up in the file explorer as @@LocalStorage (A:)@@ or @@Local (A:)@@ along with a drive named @@Data (D:)@@ the purpose of which is currently unknown. The basic functionality still exists in v1 today, which you can see by opening explorer and typing __/a/__ in the address bar showing a bunch of test files, however there is no way to save or edit files.

An early leaked version of a file mentions an app file format, in a section named Custom right next to gb, used for gameboy roms. There is also a path to it's icon, which still exists today, named magic.png. The icon, shown below, is the Windows 95 executable icon with a  smile on it, similar to the app icon used for iframe except with a blue color.

~Design~
!Design Changes

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

((https://i.imgur.com/n4Li9kT.png|Start menu with taskbar))

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

((https://i.imgur.com/eSisLIT.png|Terminal window))

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been added for testing purposes.

The terminal used to look more like the one found in [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

((https://i.imgur.com/cZLVdCC.png|Clavardage|R))

__Clavardage__ is a PHP chat based on [Blueimp's AJAX chat|https://frug.github.io/AJAX-Chat/]. The name is a french contraction of "keyboard" and "chat"). The chat had two rooms: __nature__ and __peinture__.

Clavardage was released with [v1|Windows93 v1] before quickly being shut down due to a user who came from a [Reddit Hug] exploiting it to wrote the [ILOVEYOU.TXT file|/c/ILOVEYOU.txt]. The [developers|Category developers] left the ILOVEYOU.txt file but shut down the application until [Trollbox]'s release.
Until then clicking on Clavardage icon would result in a message saying:

>directX.dll missing dude,

__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses [socket.io|http://socket.io] as it's delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

((https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/323150287399419904/688529460223410236/unknown.png|The Trollbox crown))


__The Trollbox crown__ is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Rooms~
!!Rooms
__Rooms__ act like different chatrooms in Trollbox. Users in one room cannot see messages from other rooms. These rooms can be freely created by users of Trollbox with the main room being called __atrium__. User created rooms are deleted when no users are left in them.

Rooms creation has an anti-spam filter that has a three level warning system. Whenever a user creates too many rooms they will be disconnected from Trollbox with a warning showing how much they have left before being banned. These warnings are:

*__Stop spaming. \[1/3]__ - For level 1
*__Bitch please. \[2/3]__ - For level 2
*__Want a free ban? \[3/3]__ - For level 3
*__You just lost your epic privileges.__ - For when the user is banned

After the final disconnect the user won't be able to connect to the Trollbox again. 

~Commands~
!!Commands

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called [Clavardage]. The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] and was shut down.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [Scrapped v1 Update] chat was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] by using a database and with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped before [v2|Windows93 v2]'s release.

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
*Any message containing "among us" will run the Crazy error.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*among us
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__ and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots, when they are, in fact, real users.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

The __Windows 93 v1 Beta__ refers to the state of Windows 93 between [v0|Windows93 v0] and [v1|Windows93 v1]'s release.

Windows93 v1 has had a massive amount of features removed from it before its release. Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, dragging desktop icons around and a Tetris game. Several screenshots of v1 before its release can be found in @@/c/files/images/promo@@ and show early versions during different stages in development. Some commented out code has also been left in [v1|Windows93 v1].

The v1 beta went trough several __design changes__ during development.

((https://i.imgur.com/n4Li9kT.png|Start menu with taskbar))

Instead of the current font, another font named __FFF Harmony__ was being used until late in development.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

((https://i.imgur.com/eSisLIT.png|Terminal window))

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been used for debugging.

The terminal used to look similar to the one on [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

There are some features cut from [v1|Windows93 v1] a few days after its release. A PHP chat app called [Clavardage]'s functionality was removed a few days after v1's release because of an exploit. Another app that was removed shortly after release is [Blox], which is a Tetris clone. It was broken and got quickly removed from the site.

At one point in v1's lifespan an [update|Scrapped v1 Update] was being developed for it. This update would have included the [A: Drive|a], an account system, an [online cursor clicking game|Qursor] and a new chat app running in [Terminal]. The update was scrapped in favor of some of its features making it into [v2|Windows93 v2].

((https://i.imgur.com/St8wWoq.png|Trollbox in action|R))
__Trollbox__ is an online chat introduced with the [v2|Windows93 v2] of Windows 93. It was the first social app officially introduced by the developers and involving a hundred of regular users every day, Trollbox is considered the heart of the [Windows93 community|Windows93 Discord].

It works over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can be accessed through the desktop but also directly by going to [http://windows93.net/trollbox/] or [https://windows93.net/trollbox/].

Trollbox uses socket.io as its delivery mechanism. 
The chat allows users to set a username, and color for themselves.

__The Trollbox crown__ is given to the user who is on the top of the user list at a given time.

At the time of writing, most of the time bots are the users with crowns. However Trollbox does restart from time to time which is when the user list resets.

~Rooms~
!!Rooms
__Rooms__ act like different chatrooms in Trollbox. Users in one room cannot see messages from other rooms. These rooms can be freely created by users of Trollbox with the main room being called __atrium__. User created rooms are deleted when no users are left in them.

Rooms creation has an anti-spam filter that has a three level warning system. Whenever a user creates too many rooms they will be disconnected from Trollbox with a warning showing how much they have left before being banned. These warnings are:

*__Stop spaming. \[1/3]__ - For level 1
*__Bitch please. \[2/3]__ - For level 2
*__Want a free ban? \[3/3]__ - For level 3
*__You just lost your epic privileges.__ - For when the user is banned

After the final disconnect the user won't be able to connect to the Trollbox again.

~Homes~
!!Homes
"Homes" in trollbox are encrypted and hashed IP adresses used for blocking users who change their names. They have 6 letters and/or digits. Some Trollbox bots use these for storing information about a user.

~History~
!History
There were numerous attempts to implement a chat app throughout Windows 93's history.

~v0~
!!Windows 93 v0
The [Windows 93 prototype|Windows93 v0] code has a commented out code for a PHP based chat, however some PHP files required for it are deleted and the code is non functional.

~v1~
!!Windows 93 v1
The [original release of Windows93|Windows93 v1] came with a PHP chat based on the use of text files called [Clavardage]. The application was quickly exploited by a Redditor who came from one of the [Reddit Hugs|Reddit Hug] and was shut down.

V1 also had another chat in it called [Framapad]. Framapad is a community document editing tool but the Windows 93 document was corrupted. However users could still use an anonymous chat and that chat was the birth of the proto-Windows 93 community.

~v2Alpha~
!!Windows 93 v2 Alpha
According to [the developers|Category developers], another PHP chat was being developed during the Alpha phase of [v2|Windows93 v2], it was 99% complete but had a dramatic glitch: sending the emoji 💨 caused all users' browsers to crash at the same time accompanied by a horrible screeching sound. From that point, using PHP to build the Windows93 chat was abandoned.

~v2Beta~
!!Windows 93 v2 Beta
The [Scrapped v1 Update] chat was reworked for the [v2 Beta|Windows93 v2 beta] by using a database and with the addition of the __/exe command__. However, it was also scrapped before [v2|Windows93 v2]'s release.

((https://i.imgur.com/bOQ0uki.png|v2 beta Trollbox))

~EasterEggs~
!Easter eggs
Sending a message containing specific phrases can have unexpected effects on the trollbox client
* Any message containing "__sonic__" or "__discord__" will shut down Windows93
* Sending "__roblox__" only toggles a spin effect but can be stopped by putting again "__roblox__".
* Entering "__fortnite__" will close trollbox, change the icon and display an error message.  
* Entering a message starting with "__*hugs__" will disconnect users.
*Any message containing "ddos" will not be sent
*Any message containing "among us" will run the Crazy error.
* "__FUTUR1993__" will be replaced with "•••••••••". This could be a refrence to a classic Runescape password scam, where a user would claim that attempting to send your password in the in-game chat would replace it with a series of asterisks. This would trick users into leaking their password, until the game's devs actually implemented it as a feature.
* Before Feburary 25th of 2020, entering "__discord__" would disconnect the user from Trollbox.

There's also an unused filter in the client's code that was supposed to make entered "tails" shutdown when the user types it, however it has been commented out.

~BannedNames~
!Banned Trollbox Names
This is a list of banned trollbox names. It usually replaces banned names with _anonymous_.
*undefined
*null
*blank text (have nothing as a name)
*discord
*sonic
*roblox
*fortnite
*among us
*exe - Replaces the user's name with 💩.  Before Trollbox used to have a line of code that would check if users had "exe" in their username below a comment that said "faille spam fixée", which means "spam flaw fixed". If users did have exe in their username, it would not show the user change message in the chat.
!!Reasoning
*__null__, __undefined__ and __blank text__: Banned due to programming issues
*__discord__, __sonic__, __fortnite__ and __roblox__: Users with these nicknames wouldn't be able to be blocked using /block
*__exe__: During the "faille spam fixée" era users started making scripts to have animated nicknames that contained "exe" (to not spam the chat by doing so). However, this method flooded the Trollbox server, so the line of code to hide the message was removed, and the server now changes user's nicknames to "💩" instead. The original reason for exe being banned is unknown. 

~AreThePeopleReal~
!Are the people real?
There is the common misconception that the users in Trollbox are chatbots, when they are, in fact, real users.

This misconception may be due to most of the [apps|Category apps] on the Desktop are seemingly non social, or due to an earlier Windows 93 chat app called [Messenger] being with a chatbot rather than actual people.

''Go on a tour in squats around the world with your used Asus laptop or stay confined at home to program your own operating system and change the world. Meet people, travel in 1st class, access glory and money.''

The gameplay seems similar to an older Windows 93 Simulator game.

The __Windows 93 v1 Beta__ refers to the state of Windows 93 between [v0|Windows93 v0] and [v1|Windows93 v1]'s release.

Windows93 v1 has had a massive amount of features removed from it before its release. Some of these features include the ability to save your own files, several emulators, dragging desktop icons around and a Tetris game. Several screenshots of v1 before its release can be found in @@/c/files/images/promo@@ and show early versions during different stages in development. Some commented out code has also been left in v1.

~Audio~
!!Audio
__Audio__ is the first music player made for Windows 93. It can be seen in an early screenshot. It's a basic audio file player containing several tracks from __[Zombectro]__ and __Recodd__.

~3DLab~
!!3D Lab
__3D Lab__ is a scrapped app that would render random spinning 3D models. It can still be found on [https://v1.windows93.net/c/programs/apps/3dLab].

~Emulators~
!!Emulators
The full code for 3 unused emulators, being for the __Master System__, __ZX Spectrum__, and the __Atari ST__ can still be found in [Windows93 v1] and is fully working. They were supposed to show up next to DMG-01 (the gameboy emulator) in the [Explorer]. ROMs for them still exist on [v1|Windows93 v1].

~Drives~
!!Cut drives
[v1|Windows93 v1] has had two drives cut from it. __Creators (B:)__ and __Data (D:)__. The creators drive contains folders with different names of [developers|Category developers] with shortcuts to their social media in them. It is unknown what the D: drive contains/

~Icons~
!!Draggable Desktop Icons
The ability to move Desktop icons around was scrapped from [v1|Windows93 v1].

~Design~
!Design Changes

[Windows93 v1] went trough several __design changes__ before its final release. 

((https://i.imgur.com/n4Li9kT.png|Start menu with taskbar))

Instead of the current font, the font __FFF Harmony__ was being used until close to release.

The taskbar used to display apps in grouped buttons (with centered text) and a non-fixed width. The start button had no icon and there were two buttons next to it, one for rotating the screen and one for the gravity effect. There was no RSS icon until release.

The start menu had a more simple look. It was less wide and the icons were all the same program icon.

((https://i.imgur.com/eSisLIT.png|Terminal window))

Every window used to have a footer with two sections, the right one showing the current size of the window and the left one having the actual footer text. This might have been used for debugging.

The terminal used to look similar to the one on [Windows93 v0] with a different font, more margins, emojis at the top and a different text mentioning "electronic deviant arts".

~Boot~
!!Boot
The v1 beta used a Windows XP-like boot up screen with a different logo and a Microsoft logo.

((https://i.imgur.com/oXAS1mp.png))


~Icons~
!!Scrapped Icons
Several icons were changed or scrapped before [v1|Windows93 v1]'s release.

Some apps' icons were changed before release (from left to right: [Clavardage], [Blox], [Virtual Girl], [Piskel], [Matrix|What If], [Virtual PC] and __Notes__):

((https://i.imgur.com/McQSLGt.png))

HTML, JS and image file icons were changed before release as well:

A few scrapped icons have unknown use (from left to right: @@textchat.png@@, @@neo.png@@ and @@magic.png@@):

((https://i.imgur.com/MMQBS1n.png))

According to leaked code @@magic.png@@ was used for a file format called .app, leading to speculation about custom app support in v1.

There are some scrapped 16x16 icons:

~Other~
!Other
There are some features cut from [v1|Windows93 v1] a few days after its release. A PHP chat app called [Clavardage]'s functionality was removed a few days after v1's release because of an exploit. Another app that was removed shortly after release is [Blox], which is a Tetris clone. It was broken and got quickly removed from the site.

At one point in v1's lifespan an [update|Scrapped v1 Update] was being developed for it. This update would have included the [A: Drive|a], an account system, an [online cursor clicking game|Qursor] and a new chat app running in [Terminal]. The update was scrapped in favor of some of its features making it into [v2|Windows93 v2].

__Bonzichan__ (Also known as __Bindowzuchan__ or __/b/__) is an imageboard accessible from [http://windows93.net/b/] or the /b/ drive on [Windows93].

It uses [Fikaba|https://github.com/knarka/fikaba].

Bonzichan launched in early 2018 under the name Bindowzuchan. Originally it was hidden from the main Windows 93 site and was found trough the [Backdoor].

!!2019
Near the end of June 2019 Bonzichan was taken down after a notice published by [Jankenpopp], to be replaced by a clip from "The Big Lebowski" that says "Fuck it, dude, let's go bowling.".

A few days later it was up again.

~2020~
!!2020
In 2020 Bonzichan got its current name. This is because of a post to /b/ made by a impersonator of [Jankenpopp], that claimed that if the post got 100 bumps, he would change the imageboard's name to Bonzichan. After the real Jankenpopp saw that the post had got 100 bumps, he decided to change it to Bonzichan.

Utf's Qursor recreation was later ported to [v2|Windows93 v2].

~ExtrasRecreation~
!!Extras Recreation
A Qursor recreation was made by __ziad87__ for [v2|Windows93 v2]. Unlike the accurate recreation its aim is adding extra features to make Qursor fun. Clicks on the user's desktop were added to the extras recreation to add a flavor of chaos. Sound effect and a leaderboard were also added.

This recreation was aimed for an official release after [Jankenpopp] suggested that if someone in the [Windows93 Discord] makes a fun Qursor it would be officially put on Windows 93.

- In Solitude, after a legit win, drag a king on the main pile, then back up. Repeat this a lot, and you get more cards coming out than there should.
- In Solitude, drag an ace to the top stack. Instead of letting go, quickly move your mouse out of the window. If the pink card spot underneath is still highlighted, let go of your mouse before going back in the window. The pink spot will still be highlighted without anything on it.
- In Solitude, drag a card, and drag a card that can be placed on it on the first card. If the card you first dragged is highlighted but the second card isn't on it, let go. The first card should stay highlighted without anything on it. ip:2601:645:800:4fe0:2944:976e:3384:8104

!For Trollbox Bot developers:
!!Recommendations for Trollbox Bots

- Don't use a welcome message, and instead put the bot's help command, like "[!help]" in the bot's username.
- Don't use the same prefix as another bot.
- Use Node.JS or Python for hosting the bot, instead of using a web browser, read below of why you should do it, and how.
- Get rid of HTML entities. Doesn't matter how, just do it.

!!Using Node.JS for bots

___You need headers for a trollbox bot at the moment. If you can't figure that out, then google it and learn about it, you can then continue.___

Using Node.JS or Python instead of a web browser is better because of stuff like:
- It's faster
- Runs on pretty much anything, like a phone or tablet using an app named Termux, a Raspberry Pi or any Windows, Mac, or Linux machine
- You can do more stuff, like writing to a file on your computer
- shouldn't make your browser slow down

Use @@socket.io-client@@ to connect to Trollbox, it's available for Python and Node.JS

You can find a list of all the current bots [here|List of active Trollbox bots].

- A bot or a user can not write the same thing twice in a row.
- A bot or a user can not say _discord_, since it is banned and will make the bot disconnect. Other words are banned for users, such as _sonic_, _roblox_ or _fortnite_, but these do not impact bots, since they cause UI problems.

- In Solitude, drag a card, and drag a card that can be placed on it on the first card. If the card you first dragged is highlighted but the second card isn't on it, let go. The first card should stay highlighted without anything on it. ip:2601:645:800:4fe0:e087:4539:1751:1b21

(rework)

Basically there was an appstore beta. People found the link to it and we found the beta.

Then we dug in more, and found a mass mailer. Some troll abused it ofc, and then trollbox, bindowzuchan, the store, and wiki93 were shutdown.

A few days later, it all came back (not the store). Some people were banned, and windows93 simply gave _oof._

At 9/11/18, these bans were lifted. However the troll that caused all of this was never found.

The end..............__?__

A few days later, all of the Windows93 services came back (sadly, the store did not.). Some people were banned from Windows93.net due to this.

- When you open an app on the terminal, then all apps after that that are opened with a terminal will have the same icon and title as the first one.
- Windows with FX on them have no closing animations.
- When you press enter while making a shortcut, it opens the icon window instead of making the shortcut (more of an oversight)
- Moving a folder into another folder erases all of the document's text that are in that folder.
- Applying some FX to a window (like anogram, vhs, and vh2) makes a white box around it.
- Adding a shortcut, opening the edit menu for it, deleting the shortcut, changing the icon, and trying to apply those changes makes an error and an unclosable window.
- In [Trollbox], when /emo is on, saying things like @@")@@ or @@<)@@ show an emoji when it shouldn't.
- In Trollbox, if you have /l337 or /reverse on, some other built in commands don't work.
- Kof93 has an effect that can make some processers produce a faint beep even when sound is turned off.
- Pressing start in defrag multiple times will duplicate the sound.

- On the calculator after dividing 0/0, you can press the spot where the @@=@@ once was and restart the animation.
- Catex had a bug where it's noframe.php did not escape HTML properly, leading to an exploit that let you run code in Windows93 from another domain. ([main page here|The Catex Bug])
- In the explorer, keybinds on menu actions are grayed out can still be preformed, thus fucking up teh system.
- When you run gravity, then refresh any explorer or delete, edit, rename, add, or move any file, dolphin cannot be run again and windows can float in midair.
- Windows with gravity have their menus offset, depending on their orientation.
- Closing a window with gravity will still keep its hitbox.

!!Solitude Bugs
- In [Solitude|Solitude|fuck you host], you can drag a card on the top stack even if there are cards underneath it. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card off the screen, making it scroll. Infinite scrolling
- In Solitude, you can click on cards at the bottom of the down-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag cards at the bottom of the top-facing draw pile. 
- In Solitude, you can drag a card on the top stack off and drag a card underneath it. You can do anything you want with the card underneath.
- In Solitude, you can still drag cards after the win screen appears.
- In Solitude, you can drag a card from the top of a stack and let go. Then drag the bottom card while it is going back to its original position. This should drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, do the previous bug but do it on a single card that is at the bottom of the stack. When you drag this card while it is sliding, the card above it should cling to your mouse and you can drag it offset from the mouse.
- In Solitude, the green circle that appears in the top left doesnt change your cursor despite being clickable.
- In Solitude, you can double click back facing cards and they sometimes move to the top stack. Any cards beneath it, including blue cards, will appear at the top stack.
- In Solitude, dragging the last card on the trash pile then clicking the green circle while it is still moving makes a down facing card move, which can never normally happen.
- In Solitude, after a legit win, drag a king on the main pile, then back up. Repeat this a lot, and you get more cards coming out than there should.
- In Solitude, drag an ace to the top stack. Instead of letting go, quickly move your mouse out of the window. If the pink card spot underneath is still highlighted, let go of your mouse before going back in the window. The pink spot will still be highlighted without anything on it.
- In Solitude, drag a card, and drag a card that can be placed on it on the first card. If the card you first dragged is highlighted but the second card isn't on it, let go. The first card should stay highlighted without anything on it. ip:186.90.136.217
